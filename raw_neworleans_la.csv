Stanford's Restaurant,5,I have always been confused by this listing as it appears a duplication of an Antoine‚Äôs Restaurant listing. Today I had the R√©veillon Lunch at Antoine‚Äôs. I asked the manager and he had no idea. This rating therefore is for my great experience at Antoine‚Äôs. The food was plentiful and delicious and my server could not have been better.

The Original French Market Restaurant and Bar,1,"Worse dining experience of my life. Definitely- ‚≠êÔ∏è if I could. Service was bad, restroom was bad, & the food was so horrible I was sick immediately after eating just a few bites!! I‚Äôd rather burn my $100+ spent there than eat there again. 1st time visiting  New Orleans & this experience completely ruined it for me & my family. We walked in & the vibe wasn‚Äôt friendly at all. I should have known to trust my gut feeling. The server coldly handed us menus & left. I was debating if we should leave cuz he didn‚Äôt come back for like 15mins, but I wanted to give him another chance. He quickly took our orders & left with a cold expression. My son ordered dirty rice & he said we don‚Äôt have that. So I‚Äôm like ok maybe he‚Äôs having a bad day it‚Äôs whatever. Wrong!! While waiting for our food, I went to use the restroom. Doors were broken for both stalls. Toilet paper roll on the ground & one didn‚Äôt even have toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. It was so sketchy, I decided to hold myself until we got to another bathroom. When we finally got our food it didn‚Äôt look bad but after tasting the food I felt sick right away. And wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just me. But nope!! Tried the jambalaya rice & it tasted like sour partially uncooked rice. Horrible!! Took a few bites of my seafood boiled. The potato & corn textured seemed ok but the flavor was very strange. You‚Äôd think since Louisiana is know for their seafood boils it‚Äôll be at least edible. I don‚Äôt know what seasoning they put in their seafood boiled, but ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. I ate one shrimp & it tasted like I was eating raw stanky fish. I had a few other people tried it & said it was bad too. I immediately decided we shouldn‚Äôt eat anymore of our food. I didn‚Äôt don‚Äôt want us to get food poisoning since we were on a road trip & had many stops to go yet. Our bill was $100+ for the most nastiest food ever. My husband was so kind he still left a tip despite how horrible everything was. I literally was trying hard not to vomit as we were walking out of the restaurant. I barely made it out before vomiting outside & on the way to the public restroom a few blocks away. It was so bad I couldn‚Äôt get rid of that nasty taste in my mouth. I drank half a bottle of coke & ate ice cream to cleanse my palate. Finally stopped my urges to vomit. My hands stank like raw fish even after washing my hands 20 times at 5 different bathrooms. I have never left a online review for a restaurant before, but I want to warn people about how horrible this experience was. It‚Äôs so sad that there was absolutely nothing good about this restaurant.

Not worth the hype. Crawfish etoufee was meh--bland seasoning and chewy crawfish. Shrimp creole was meh---bland seasoning and the Shrimp did not taste fresh at all. There was a distinct previously frozen taste. Jambalaya was very very dry and the sausage was burned.
Felt rushed by the waiter. Fumes from the seafood seasoning permeated the restaurant unlike any other restaurant I've been to before and made us sneeze frequently and made our eyes water.

Swoop's Supper Club | NOLA,5,"I cannot say enough fabulous things about this beautiful venue and Ms. Linda Novak, its proprietress and event coordinator. I approached Ms. Novak with less than one (1) months‚Äô notice and an unusual request to propose to my girlfriend there after discovering that the Swoop-Duggins House was open for private events ‚Äì years ago, my girlfriend (now fianc√©e) and I had our very first date ‚ÄúCellar Door‚Äù (bar operated by previous tenant/owner), but I had been advised that it had been shut down in Hurricane Ida. I was so thrilled to see that Ms. Novak was now hosting events in the space again and invited myself over for a walk-through as soon as I got in contact with her. Despite my paltry budget (much less than she normally agrees to rent the space for); an insanely complicated plan for a proposal (I had to lead my girlfriend in through a side entrance that she‚Äôd not recognize, then ask Ms. Novak to herd in in 30 guests to the front room within a 5-minute window before bringing my fianc√©e out to propose to her on the balcony where Ms. Novak had provided a perfect ‚Äúhiding spot‚Äù under a tablecloth for my friend to photograph the proposal, after which I brought her down the courtyard steps where she coordinated the timing of my friend‚Äôs dad‚Äôs trumpet-playing); an ever-changing number of guests and menu items (from 12 to 35 and then back down to an eventual 30); and two highly-invested mothers participating in the surprise, Ms. Novak graciously and seamlessly pulled off an engagement event that most people that I was crazy for even attempting.

Ms. Novak spent weeks working with me and my friends and family to ensure that everything went right in this multi-layered plan that likely would take the award for ‚Äúvenue‚Äôs worst nightmare event‚Äù ‚Äì from coordinating walk-throughs in the week leading up to the event, to actually playing a part in the surprise herself (she went so far as to make fake signage and decorations for another ‚Äúevent‚Äù that was to take place that night; and put her acting skills to work to make my charade more believable), she was beyond incredible. All of my guests asked whether she was a wedding coordinator that we could hire, given her flawless facilitation of the entire evening ‚Äì if only she were available to handle my wedding! Needless to say, my fianc√©e was thrilled and said yes. We now hope to plan an engagement party or wedding event at the Swoop-Duggins House next year.

As for the venue itself, Ms. Novak has done an impeccable job of decorating the space down to the very last detail ‚Äì it is New Orleans through and through, and captures the essence of the Crescent City through its d√©cor and ambiance. Cocktails and appetizers were of course fabulous, as well. No way to go wrong with this venue and Ms. Novak.

Batture Bistro and Bar,5,"Traveled on business last week and came across the GEM of a place, right behind where I was staying. Had I had knowledge of the Hotel portion, One 11, I would have stayed there instead. All I can say is the meal I had was the highlight of the trip. I was greeted by Gari who worked the bar, made perfect drinks, and was a pleasure to talk with. The man in the kitchen, Rob, sent out small plates of the most delicious food I have eaten in quite some time. Kudos to both of them.

I lost my appetite and told the manager to just take this away. He stormed away while I was in mid sentence and said we just took it off. No apology just a lot of sass.

We travel and eat out lots. Also being a Hindu vegetarian can write lots about this place.
This restaurant had many new dishes which we don‚Äôt find in other Indian restaurants in NOLA.
It took real long for our order and the portions were very small. The menu is glorified and all necessary accomplishments not served with appetizers or meals.
We order the Paruppu wada for $10. Two small pieces of hard wada served without any chutney. Please don‚Äôt order this appetizer as it was too dry and no taste at all.
We also ordered the Gobi Manchurian was tiny portion and dry without main ingredients like garlic.
The main reason of our visit was to try the Gutti Vankaya, a fancy name for the eggplant curry.
The peanut based curry was great but eggplants were not cooked to the perfection. Literally we ate curry sauce with rice.

Who Dat Coffee Cafe,1,"Poor service and rude owner..

When my group arrived here I opened the front door without stepping in in order to ask if we could be seated outside.  The host rudely yelled at me to put a mask on. My intention was to sit outside to avoid digging out a mask but rather then simply tell me I could go ahead and have a seat the host wouldn't answer me until I put one on. He then told me I could sit at 2 tables. Half of my group was already there and we took a seat at one table.  The server walked by our table twice but did not greet us. The rest of my group arrived and took a seat at the other table.  They had a separate server that brought them water immediately.  My table continued to wait so I went to ask if we had a server coming.  A server told me he would be right with us. I apologized but told him my boyfriend needed to get to the airport soon.  He brought waters to our table.  At that time he took our food and drink order. The second table had their food order taken about 5 minutes after us. All of their food came out more than 10 minutes before ours. After waiting a total of 45 minutes after giving our order my boyfriend went in to ask them to box our food and pay the bill as we no longer had time to eat.  It seemed that the slow service was purposeful as we were overlooked several times.

I was also not impressed with the food.  Small portions and over priced.

Once learning of my poor experience I was contacted by the owner.  Rather then apologize for the bad experience he berated and name called me for writing the review.

I do not recommend this restaurant.",2024-03-21T14:50:01.435Z,5,,88,TRUE,2024-03-31T22:35:29.039Z,,a month ago,,Lunch,,$10‚Äì20,,Dine in,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMXFMVUt3EAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,115375223982497479691,,,,

Once you wrap it up, they have a lounge upstairs called the Hummingbird on the weekend! Dope drinks and rooftop vibes... Talk about the perfect spot for an all evening into night date night spot or a time on the town with your girls!

They have a more family-friendly location - Algiers Point - much more spacious, but offers the same great quality of good, drinks, and vibes! There isn't a lounge at this location, but it doesn't take anything away from it.

Whichever your mood, check out either of the locations!

Sneaky Pickle & Bar Brine,5,"With a name like Sneaky Pickle, we thought the menu would be full of pickle plates. We were wrong, but it's still worth visiting. It's more than worth visiting. It's among the best food we had while spending six days in New Orleans. Dining around 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday in April, here's our experience.

1) Food: Everything we ate was delicious starting with the oysters and ending with the wagyu burger, which my seven-year-old daughter enjoyed too. The sunchokes are unique and worth ordering. My mother-in-law loved the squid ink pasta and my wife really enjoyed the buffalo tofu lettuce wraps (what they are known for).

2) Drink: Their menu includes cocktails, beer, wine, and more. I ordered a rainbow sherbet sour ale. My wife liked their brine drink for a savory option.

3) Service: From the hostess to the server, everyone was kind, efficient, and welcoming. Our food was perfectly timed.

4) Space: It's beautiful with a large indoor dining room and a bar. There are two unisex restrooms in the back near the stairs to the second level, which I assumed was for staff only.

5) Area: We found free street parking nearby. Located inside Bywater, it's a great neighborhood to walk around after dinner, finding little houses and parks. For dessert, we walked to nearby Big O's Original Popsicle Doorbell.",2024-04-18T03:27:28.172Z,1,,3282,TRUE,,,6 days ago,,,,,,,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaE5qM2N3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPxOfdY4Jt5-KTm5PcaNBk-xjX1CPMYXOmnklz=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNptnnZ0OrdNj8_EnHq1v4ipHfvvosljs9oYzNX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOEYHNfsuN3RDAWM8cV620_4PYdQoE3MDx6syf=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX8KlDvCfPFbxayr2xUdOTrSbTrrbzFLYCDm2g=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1hu5uHi_lfLKIkPDUNOtZnuDIqhcrIPQc1P4p=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTADprdFb6MIz8-6gidaUTkoxQ0negC83j9ykT=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7CTnKMfPzJEW0gqLictFMbVG-vO33jMr37Qkw=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8qK-vfGRCZ6x11dS7qO49FcagneERkm5sdif8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9HqQRgBB-zJUKc561QoDpX79SZMlFr-jrQnCU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqf6ZyLNR00_A-jlfhnC0lmRsU42o9_kc4jgf6=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGfVevITuPoA70cR4e0U91X_VOfkbe15fhCble=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,101810068829626301924,,,,

District All Day Delicious,5,"Oh. My. God. If you‚Äôre thinking about going - do it. Immediately.

We originally went as I was looking for a brunch restaurant that could accommodate my dad (he‚Äôs in a wheelchair/service dog), and we were also looking for something that prioritizes their food quality. Look, I like NOLA but I was tired of the standard, touristy, overpriced options. The pancakes in the Google listing + ability to make a reservation made the choice easy for us.

When we arrived we were greeted by the co-owner and immediately felt welcomed. It was an awesome surprise to also find that they offered delicious coffee options and we promptly ordered. We ordered an array of coffee (honey cinnamon latte, honey lavender latte, and iced vanilla bean logged - all delicious!) and for food the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, BLT, and Hot Chicken & Honey Biscuit. The pancakes are INCREDIBLE. My mother - who LOVES pancakes - was obsessed with them. The BLT was great and the hot chicken was so-so, but was made up by the delicious potatoes served as a side.

Upon leaving we immediately planned another day to come for breakfast for more pancakes. Upon our second visit we got more pancakes (the lemon + the Pigs in a Blanket), coffees, and the GM Plate. We were all satisfied and became curious on how they created the most perfect pancakes recipe. I‚Äôm not kidding - I hate pancakes and will now dream of them.

If you‚Äôre considering this place just do yourself a favor and go. Sure, the more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù choice is on the corner of the same strip, but it doesn‚Äôt compare to this place. Truly. The service, the atmosphere, and the menu are fantastic. Amazing!!

P.S. they have doughnuts/pastries and house-made ice cream as well.

I sat down and was ignored for at least 5 min, the bar was not busy at all there were maybe 6 people total including myself! FInally a woman came up to me said hi and I asked if I could see a menu, she gave me one and proceeded to clean up around me, helped several other patrons at the bar, I sat there another 5-7min with NOTHING in front of me, not even offered a water! I finally just left after I saw 4 men being attended to, they already had drinks and water! Then I saw another man being offered a refill on his wine to seats awsy from me, I was thinking this cannot be real, do they not see me? There was three people behind the bar. This was offensive and will spread the word not to bother going if your a woman eating alone, plain and simple rude and uncalled for.

Rib Room,4,"Went for dinner on a Monday night with coworkers, we‚Äôre all also staying at the hotel. Reservation at 7:15, sat around 7:20. No one came by the table to even take appetizer orders for at least 20 minutes. A guy eventually came over with bread in that 20 mins and we asked him for our server.

I speak for the whole table when I say the overall service was subpar for the price, we each spent $50-100 to only have water filled once, if that, and a hefty wait in between ordering, receiving food, and checks. My check was also incorrect which ended up costing an extra 15 mins to fix that. Food was ok, but it‚Äôs not worth the languishing service attitude and several mistakes on the orders.

All in all, we were out a little after 9 and exhausted as we have to work each day starting at 6am. Likely won‚Äôt be back unless it‚Äôs room service or bar food.

Edit: I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect this review to carry any weight in the world at all, not even in the slightest. I assumed it would get lost within all reviews never to be seen again. But within hours of me posting the hotel set out to make it right which is crazy. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize the hotel is so involved with the restaurant or even cared what went on in it!

Caf√© Fleur De Lis,5,"I came to this corner cafe for breakfast. I ordered shrimp and grits plus a biscuit. The shrimps tasted fresh. Honestly I hated grits but because shrimp and grits seemed to be a famous New Orleans dish. I felt it necessary to give it a try.

It turned out that the grits mixed well with the shrimp sauce and the melty cheese, which tasted a bit salty. The biscuit was a separate order, but I am glad that I ordered it because if I ate the grit alone it would be too salty for me. By the way, the biscuit was quite buttery but not fluffy enough.

Gabrielle Restaurant,3,"Went there for dinner with a childhood friend last week.

We started with an order of 4 of the appetizers intending to do a tapas kind of thing for dinner. (Everything but the pate).

The server was adamant that we had to select an entree. We explained that we wanted to look at the menu some more.

Truth be told, I had looked at the menu and honestly nothing spoke to me. I'm a bit of a simpleton and prefer simple food cooked well. The offerings here are a lot of things, simple isn't one of them.

After a bit of a stand off, the server departed in a huff with our order.

The appetizers were good, but like everything else there is just too much going on for me. Too many flavors competing on your tongue.

Eventually we ordered gumbo and a caprese salad.

The gumbo was simply okay. I had had a significantly better cup of gumbo at a popular restaurant in bucktown the night before. In addition there was a very slight fishy taste to the gumbo telling me it wasn't the freshest thing in the world.

The caprese salad was fine except for the balsamic vinegar, which was the refined version that is sweet. Typically the refined is put on ice cream and such. Don't know if it really works on a salad, definitely not for me.

I guess this all would have been ok if the bill for 3 people wasn't $300.

The gumbo soup was bitter.  The duck was chewy--normal. I informed Gabrielle I found the soup bitter. She did not respond to my query until I asked twice, and she said the roux is very dark but not burnt.

If a gumbo tastes bitter the roux is burned.

The bread and butter was delicious.

The club soda was very refreshing, but the glass of Pinot Noir average.

Mena's Palace,5,"We were staying at the Wyndam Hotel (April 4,5,6,7,8), and it is literally around the corner! We asked the front desk staff and two of them said Mena's (in unison?!?!?!).  200 St Chartres.  Ok, so they liked Mena's. We also asked a pedicab driver - again Mena!  So, we tried it. So glad we found it early in our vacation. We were there for all breakfasts from then on. Great food, great employees - felt like home. Unfortunately, we didn't discover their lunch menu until the last day (try the muffaletta - I wanted to take some home!) It was so soft and flavorful.  Lots of options too.  While it didn't affect us - they have a bar, too!
The servers were very positive and friendly! The two we used (and enjoyed) were Dymond and Jamayra. Mena only does breakfast/lunch and that is fine. However, we would have lived there if they did dinner too!
Not fancy-shmansy but clean, friendly and very good food. We will be back!

Yawdi Jamaican Restaurant/ Food supplies,2,"I can‚Äôt eat at Yawdi anymore. Every time I‚Äôm in there they are out of oxtail and items on the menu (at the restaurant). Today I saw them at an event and ran up to ask if the oxtail was in stock. It was. I now know why. It was a $25 plate. I was happy to support. At checkout the girl adds 18% tip to my purchase and tried to just skip through to have me sign. I'm staring at the handheld machine thinking, ""did she just put 18% on my order and not at least tell me??"" They get my food together and then she realizes she didn‚Äôt add my side of plantains I ordered. So it's going to be another $5. I watch her the second time and sure enough i see her pause and then quickly select the 18% again. üòë So then i ask her. She said a bunch stuff that makes absolutely no sense ""it's going to charge you $5 so im fixing it‚Ä¶"" Sure. I finally look at her realizing she's not disclosing how shes pricing all of this and isn't going to tell me the truth. I get home, eat my side of plantains, they're what I wanted. I open up my plate and I'm dumbfounded. Half the plate is rice. I tried it, it was ok. I thought it was meant to be a side, but it was most of the styrofoam container. I try the mac n cheese. Meh‚Ä¶it was not worth the dairy issues to eat it (for me). My mom and I do make really good mac though, so I'm bougie lol. But the OXTAIL wad an afterthought!

Criollo Restaurant,5,"All of my senses were OVERWHELMED with pleasure at Criollo's Jazz Brunch! The service and food was superb Michelin level quality. The live jazz band kept me entertained as I was coursed out. The chef elevated the fried green tomatoes and chicken biscuit to an award winning level. The chicken biscuit was smothered in jalape√±o's, scallions and the best rue I have ever tasted so I sent my compliments to the chef. Every delectable bite forced my eyes shut so I could deeply enjoy the freshness, flavor and texture. While I was enjoying coffee the chef sent complimentary Rosemary & Lemon Custard Madeline's. It was an innovative way to approach this classic pastry. My only critique is the custard on top was so good I wanted more. Very light, fresh, and balanced melody of flavors. The consistency was reminiscent of a fusion between a scone and puff pastry. You can tell the French invited fries by how well the fries here complimented every dish. It was such a phenomenal experience, I found myself making reservations for the next day halfway through brunch and I am happy to say the food, service and entertainment are consistently great here. The fancy French atmosphere at Hotel Monteleone was fit for a Queen and the bathroom attendant cleaned the stall prior to each guests use.

St. Roch Market,5,"This is such a unique location in New Orleans. Picture the French Market but nicer, cleaner, and enclosed.

There are several restaurants within St. Roch that serve Cuban, Mexican, Japanese, and Cajun food (more than that). Everything I've had here is delicious (albeit a little expensive, especially if you get a drink).

Besides food, St. Roch is also a great studying location. The building has plenty of windows and tables, making it perfect for work. There's also a wonderful coffee shop as well that serves delicious drinks and pastries.

Also, the service here is wonderful. Although each booth has its own employees (they're okay) the stars of the show are the St. Roch ""waiters."" They constantly clean the tables and make sure you have iced, filtered water along with your meal.

Broussards Restaurant & Courtyard,3,"the restaurant is incredibly beautiful.   we were the first people in the dining room at 515 on Monday.   We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees.   The waitress recommended the porkchop, describing it as  ""juicy"".  My wife's meal was good.  My porkchop was overcooked and dry.  I ate about 30% of it, hoping ""juicy"" would be in the middle somewhere.   I mentioned that to the other waiter (every table has 2) and he laughed like I was telling a joke.

The subtle complaint is lost on this place.   if you get poor quality like I did, I would recommend just sending it back.   Another oddity, they don't clear plates between courses.   The man literally shoved my plate to the other side of the table spilling the silverware on the tablecloth in the process.

The bread pudding is delicious, though it was a little abrupt to have the check tossed on the table 60 seconds after the dessert was served.",2024-04-16T10:05:34.165Z,0,,56,TRUE,2024-04-17T17:07:51.293Z,,a week ago,,Dinner,,$50‚Äì100,,Dine in,5,3,3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREXy1ERVdnEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,103310163869648529879,,,,

Subway,1,"Just avoid this location.
We ordered online to pick it up in store, after putting the order we found out that one of our sandwiches do not have a complete list of ingredients we wanted, so when we got to the store, we asked to add at least some sauce in that sandwich. After some ignorance, the lady refused and said I am done with this sandwich, we asked again and she just pour some sauce in a plastic glove!!! and gave it to us! Disgusting!!

Dian Xin,4,"Visiting the quarter and wanted some Chinese, so this was one of the first spots we kept seeing show up online.

The best two items were: The crab/crawfish dumplings, fantastic. And, the saut√©ed green beans. They are crisp and hot, but still tender inside. A bit too much sauce for me, though.

Runner ups: The steamed pork buns. Stuffed with a good amount of meat inside, they were super fresh and soft. The basil popcorn chicken. So crispety and crunchy, and served piping hot. Egg rolls were different than traditional ones. Not as much of a cronch on them, but still good.

The char siu pork was sadly probably my least favorite item. It needs more char, and less of whatever sauce they're using, they need more of that traditional red sauce (see photos).

The atmosphere was okay. Again, we went hoping we could watch the LSU baseball game since there were a lot of TVs, but we never got an answer if we could change it. The actual seats we sat in though were comfortable.

Stopped in for a pre-gig meal and some drinks before my Mardi Gras ball.

Was greeted right away and grabbed a seat at the bar.

Started off with a Goose Island IPA and ordered the Vitascope Burger with fries.

After my meal I got the Smoked Old Fashioned as my after dinner cocktail.

Glad I stopped by before my gig. The staff were very friendly and made my visit extremely comfortable.

I'll definitely be back.

Vitascope Hall,5,"Excellent service and food. We were pleasantly surprised after seeing other reviews at how wonderful the service was from our arrival through the end of our meal. We requested a change of table twice, due to the location of the (way too many) TV screens everywhere, and the staff was very accommodating.

Our server Luka was outstanding, providing thoughtful recommendations, as well as prompt and friendly service. He went over and above to get our beverages just how we wanted. For food, The charbroiled oysters were a standout- the best out of 3 different spots we‚Äôve tried them in this trip. We also enjoyed the pesto pasta dish, which had a nice balance of fresh and spicy flavors. And the turkey club was good, too.

I didn‚Äôt love the blaring TVs everywhere theme. It seems like having the gigantic multiple screen spread over the bar would be plenty for those who are there to watch sports in a group setting. We asked to have the one at our table turned off, and Luka was able to get the volume off, but having the screen playing corny commercials the whole time felt invasive.

The Court of Two Sisters,4,"I understand that when you offer a buffet the food needs to be prepared for a basic pallet but  some things were bland, overcooked or undercooked. The prime rib was overdone, the wild rice was undercooked, and the garlic mashed potatoes lacked salt and garlic however the omelet/egg station was excellent. My husband loved that they freshly poached eggs for the eggs Benedict and the hollandaise was homemade. The peel and eat shrimp, grits and creamed spinach were excellent and the service was good. Our server Derrick was really nice and I always appreciate someone with a smile.

She said she would rush our food, and shortly after, sure enough our entrees appeared. They were lukewarm so they had likely been sitting a while, but the food nonetheless were good. Then our appetizers showed up (we never did get our salads or dessert) and so we began asking for adjustments to our bill. In the end, after arguing and a very confusing comp/cashier experience, we were told we had to pay for our entrees because we ate the food. Fair enough, I suppose, so we did that, but it took another 30 minutes to sort out the final bill.

Daisy Dukes Express,1,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to grab some breakfast and this place was highly recommended and had great reviews. We arrived and were seated immediately which was great as there were only 3 other tables with customers at them but it took over 15 minutes before we were attended to. The hostess came by about half way through and said ‚Äúshe comin ya‚Äôll‚Äù. The waiter came over apologized and took our food and drink orders and then disappeared in the back again for more than 20minutes. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit and my boyfriend got a brunch burger. Someone else brought out our food and they had my breakfast sandwich on toast instead of a biscuit as I ordered and when I told her it was supposed to be on a biscuit she then asked me ‚Äúwell do you want me to take it back?‚Äù My boyfriend‚Äôs brunch burger was supposed to have cheese, bacon, egg and a patty on it and it came out with no bacon or cheese. We had to send that back as well. By the time they brought both of our plates back out our food wasn‚Äôt even hot. Our waiter came out and apologized for the mix up then went in the back again and we had ask the busser once we were done eating for our check bcs our waitress was still in the back.

Overall, our waiter was not attentive at all and we had to search for her whenever we needed something when there were only 3 other tables with customers in the whole place. when the food finally came out it was wrong and then by the time it was remade and brought out it was cold.",2024-03-27T14:31:09.709Z,0,,4,TRUE,,,4 weeks ago,,Brunch,,$10‚Äì20,,Dine in,2,2,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeHFUNEx3EAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,115098332361442748721,,,,

Meals From the Heart Cafe,5,I want to go back to New Orleans so I can eat here again. They have a separate vegan menu that has so many great choices-including beignets!

The sausage patty was the worst! a blackened orange-ish mush. I went back for beignets, and I'm so glad I did! I am sure they are also probably amazing for lunch.

Meals From the Heart Cafe,5,"I was visiting New Orleans for a business trip April 15-17. I came across Meals From The Heart on TikTok. I decided to try this restaurant because the reviews on TikTok were good. Upon arrival I met the cashier. Her service was OK. I ordered the crabcake, a small gumbo and a cold pressed orange juice. I was really excited about the food as I haven‚Äôt had any good vegan food since I visited New Orleans. A lot of the restaurants that I wanted to visit were closed or had closed early. I first tried the gumbo and it was OK. I wish that it had more rice, vegetables and mushrooms. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct way to describe it, but it was very loose and not very thick. The next thing I tried was the crabcake and it was OK. If it were not for the sauce I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been that great. The orange juice however was pretty good. Overall with tip I spent about $40. The crabcake alone was $10. My suggestion is that For $10 you should get two crabcakes and the gumbo should be thicker maybe add some more vegetables, mushrooms and rice I left feeling unsatisfied. I was disappointed with the portion of food I received for the amount of money I spent.

I had the vegan crab cake po‚Äôboy which was good, so I can only imagine that the traditional crab cake po‚Äôboy is amazing as well! I would most definitely come back to try that out or any of the other delicious looking options. They had a variety of food options with a lot of traditional New Orleans fares as well like red beans, okra gumbo and beignets. So I would say this is a great place to try some true NOLA foods.

Cleo's,2,"I used to work at a Lebanese restaurant in Seattle so maybe I'm spoiled but one of my Favorite foods is Chicken Shawarma pita wraps.  I went here from word of mouth so maybe it was an off day for the place but unfortunately for me my Shawarma wrap was way below expectation and the hype.
The chicken was extremely dry, there was A LOT of it though so there's that? Might have been what made it hard to swallow but the Taziki was also super dry, paste like, and there were no tomatoes and light lettuce.  Plus for $12 bucks it was kinda small, like 6"" long, maybe if it came with a pop it would have been more satisfying but I was on the run and figured it had tomatoes and Taziki, but it was SO dry I couldn't eat it while walking! I had to wait till later and later wasn't much better. I don't know what to tell you guys, but this was a disappointment to me and I had wished I gotten a shrimp poboy instead down the road.",2024-03-28T13:59:00.979Z,0,,70,TRUE,,,3 weeks ago,,Brunch,Difficult to find parking,$10‚Äì20,,Take out,2,2,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEN3VtSE9BEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,109280781440561186910,,,,

Blue Bayou Restaurant and Oyster Bar,2,"We visited Blue Bayou later in the evening when we were out looking for an after dinner drink and some dessert. The atmosphere looked inviting, and a quick review of their sidewalk menu lead us to believe we had found the place.  There weren‚Äôt many people in the restaurant but the bartender looked like a ball of frenetic energy. She was running around and asked us if we had been waited on yet, we said no and then she rushed away. A few minutes later, an engaging server stopped by and took our order. We ordered two desserts and four drinks. The desserts arrived long before the drinks and were not as shown in the menu. The menu describes a large slice of banana fosters cheesecake topped with sliced bananas and whipped cream. We received a sliver of cheesecake with no bananas. The sliver wasn‚Äôt enough for two. Three of our four drinks arrived after we finished our desserts, one drink was MIA. Mine was supposed to have rum in it but I couldn‚Äôt taste any. I chalked that up to the nutmeg on top. Another drink was supposed to be a lemon drop and tasted like water and lemon. We knew, with 100% certainty that the drinks were heavily watered down when the fourth drink finally arrived. It was supposed to be one of their signature drinks, an Old Fashioned. What is typically a beautiful dark caramel liquid, with a small amount of ice, dark cherry, bitters, sugar or simple syrup and maybe an orange slice came out looking like a slightly beige glass of water with a maraschino cherry and filled to the brim with ice. It was so watered down that the bourbon was hardly detectable. No simple syrup or sugar was used. And the bitters that make an OF so special were missing as well. Our server was great, I really wish I remembered his name!  The music was interesting‚Ä¶ but we won‚Äôt be going back.",2024-04-24T12:42:14.999Z,0,,32,FALSE,,,7 hours ago,,Other,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,3,1,4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqemRDNS1RRRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,106112303728611669338,,,,

Blue Bayou Restaurant and Oyster Bar,1,"My wife and I had a terrible experience with this establishment. There were warning signs early that we ignored, so ultimately we could have avoided our lackluster dining experience.
We walked up to the hostess station and were greeted by a young woman who was in the middle of dealing with her false eyelashes falling off, so we waited while she dealt with her personal emergency. She was very nice and apologetic for it, I'm sure that she was quite embarrassed. The restaurant wasn't busy at the moment, maybe a total of 5 tables, this is a large restaurant. We waited roughly 5 minutes for our server to greet us, placed a drink order along with an appetizer order. The server brought our waters and said our drinks would be out shortly. We started hearing the kitchen yelling for service for several minutes, the wait staff were elsewhere at this point, and then we started seeing the kitchen staff attempting to bring out the orders themselves. They were obviously confused as the whole each item was supposed to go to, but they were making an attempt. Kudos to the back of house for making an effort. They did make some negative comments about their coworkers as they were returning to the kitchen, we were sat by the kitchen so got to be the audience.

We received our appetizer after a few minutes of it being passed around from person to person before finally making it's way to our server.
We waited 10 minutes for our drinks to finally make it to our table, not promising for such a large business that wasn't busy. We had ordered the crab cake appetizer, it was very small, good flavor and quite a lot of crab for what looks like a 3 ounce cake. I would have been a little happier for either a little more or little less expensive ($26), this is obviously in the heart of the tourist trap but this was egregious even with that in mind. My entree was delivered within minutes of the drinks and appetizer. I had ordered the Blue Bayou shrimp Poboy, I was surprised by how much shrimp was on the sandwich especially after how small the appetizer was. My food sat on the table untouched for nearly 10 minutes before our server came to check on us, finding my wife's entree had never been delivered. She went back to the kitchen to check, came back out to apologize and said that the missing entree would be delivered shortly. We waited another 15 minutes for my wife's shrimp and grits entree, my food was now cold and we began eating our dinner.
The Poboy was not bad, even for being cold, it lacked some of the bold flavor you would expect for a Creole BBQ shrimp poboy but was more than edible. The side of fries were very good, large portions of shrimp and fries.
My wife said the shrimp and grits were okay, not as good as the same dish from the Ruby Slipper I had ordered for breakfast on the same day for significantly less money. But she did enjoy the dish well enough.

The server did offer to comp a glass of wine to make amends for the poor timing of the service, we declined and finished our meal. We found the service at this restaurant to be seriously lacking compared to the other establishments we visited during our visit to the city. The prices were on par with higher end establishments, but it falls short of the competition in my experience. We didn't walk in with any expectations, but we left disappointed with the overall experience.  We would not return or recommend this restaurant. There are too many great places to enjoy good food and drink in this city, avoid this lackluster tourist trap.

**Also of note - this restaurant charges an additional 3% on card payments, and they're a cashless business.

Dooky Chase Restaurant,4,"My husband and I were determined to have dinner here. Dooky Chase is only open for dinner on Friday & Saturday evenings and reservations were hard to get. I ended up calling there one afternoon right before they closed to make our reservation.

The inside of the restaurant is beautifully elegant, filled with gorgeous art. I had the fried chicken, which was delicious and just a bit spicy, and my husband had the stuffed jumbo shrimp. We ended up taking a box home. I recommend the rum punch as a cocktail. We finished off with some piping hot praline bread pudding.

The service was excellent and we were glad we got an opportunity to eat here.",2024-04-17T19:27:18.715Z,0,,28,FALSE,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,$30‚Äì50,,Dine in,5,4,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdVBxcGh3RRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,108705205086949777025,,,,
Dooky Chase Restaurant,5,"After years of trying, we finally coordinated the timing of a visit to New Orleans that allowed a reservation for lunch at Dooky Chase. It also coincided with a monster rain storm that saw crazy street flooding with 6 inches per hour falling from the sky and submerging the streets.

The staff could not have been more welcoming, nor the dining room more elegant. I absolutely had to try the Creole gumbo, and it's now my favorite gumbo in New Orleans (sorry, Mr. B""s).  The meal was excellent, the service above and beyond. And with suggested wine pairing were spot on.

When it was time to leave, the water was up to the steps leading out to the street. The hostess insisted we leave through the back door where the water had not yet reached and led us through the kitchen, a fascinating side trip by itself. She then waited with us in the parking lot under our Uber arrived. Talk about commitment to customer service!

It was a wonderful experience on an historically bad weather day.",2024-04-17T14:14:02.649Z,1,,242,TRUE,,,a week ago,,Lunch,,$30‚Äì50,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbUx5U2VREAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,109341814886672016253,,,,
Dooky Chase Restaurant,1,"AVOID this restaurant!!! One of worst dining experiences ever. We had reservation at 05:30 for 5 people and when arrived we were told to head to bar had a mix up for our table. No one ever came to get us after said would just be a few minutes . We headed back up to hostess desk after waiting for amount of time we were told. We stood another couple minutes in the line near hostess desk and were finally called. The hostess desk is very unorganized and whole reservation system is very poorly managed. We headed to our table at 05:50 we didn‚Äôt get waited on until 06:20 and this was after several waiters walked by and the large table behind us sat after us and got waited on before us . We waited over an hour for our food and we had to have someone from our table go to host desk and inquire about order because our waitress disappeared. She then came by table after inquiring about order and told our ticket was up next it was an hour and ten minutes to get four entrees. I understand delays happen but your staff shows no care or concern . We talked to ‚Äúkitchen manager ‚Äú and host at desk and they showed no concern. No manager ever came by table to check in which is so bizarre . After stating how long waited for food the waitress said can offer dessert on the house. After one of us said just take their one entree off before we got food, she had to realize we waited too long. At this point we just wanted to leave it was ridiculous it took that long as other people that sat after us and only had 2-5 people in party and had over 5 tables  around us that got food before us. This establishment is severely lacking in customer service, hospitality and atmosphere. Stay away unless you want to have bad dining experience and poor customer service. Lastly, tried to contact restaurant thru their  email listed on website and email does not even work! It got returned as undeliverable email address  . It was a shame no one in management came by table to check in or apologize , even after several staff members were aware what happened with our service.",2024-04-16T13:11:10.768Z,1,,7,FALSE,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,1,1,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREa2RyRTVnRRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,104528530355000243807,,,,

Galatoire's,4,"While strolling the heart of Bourbon Street, stride into a world of refined elegance at Galatoire's in New Orleans, where over 100 years of tradition converge with exquisite culinary craftsmanship. From the moment you enter through its French doors, you are enveloped in an atmosphere of sophistication and old-world charm. You are treated to a dining experience that is both traditional and refined, a true celebration of Louisiana's rich culinary heritage*. Impeccable service and classic Creole dishes await each bite a testament to the restaurant's commitment to excellence. It is a place where tradition meets innovation and where every meal is an unforgettable celebration of food, family, and community.

üç≤What I Tasted: The appetizer quartet showcased flavors from the indulgent crab maison to the crispy fried oysters. For the main course, fresh local saut√©ed fish adorned with seasonal crawfish Etouff√©e. The fish had a delicate yet rich flavor profile that melted in your mouth. The optional lemon caper beurre blanc sauce, with champagne, was the perfect complement to the fish, adding a velvety smoothness and subtle acidity and saltiness to each bite.

üí° Standout Feature: their unwavering dedication to preserving Creole traditions while infusing modern flair sets it apart. With every bite, you are transported to a bygone era of refined dining, where the vibrant culture of Louisiana comes to life.

‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Mid: While some may find the classic decor and attentive service charming, others may perceive it as slightly rigid or stuffy. It has all the qualities of rigid service, former attire, and feeling of exclusive clientele but without the real upscale elegance of refined dining elements However, whether the ambiance suits your taste is subjective and may depend on your dining preference.

Galatoire's,3,"This restaurant is definitely overhyped in New Orleans. Securing a reservation can be tough, which might give you the impression that everyone is clamoring to dine at Galatoire's. They enforce a formal dress code, and if you arrive without a jacket, they'll provide you with one if you want to sit in the main dining area. You'll quickly notice that the clientele tends to be on the older side.
Once you're seated and handed the menu, the waiters are quite focused on upselling you on various items. We opted for a crab salad to start, and honestly, it was presented in the most disappointing manner I've ever seen from a high-end restaurant. Our main courses, shrimp creole and crab sardou with spinach and artichoke, also lacked in presentation. While the taste was decent, it fell short of gourmet standards, especially given the price.
Service wasn't particularly efficient either; we observed waiters wandering around aimlessly. I'm not trying to criticize the place unfairly, but I truly don't believe it deserves to be ranked among the city's top restaurants.

Galatoire's,3,"3rd visit. First two were amazing, and this time definitely not......

We prefer to not dress up too much and sit in the bar area, and have always loved every minute of it. This time we were told the bar area was full (even though there were clearly empty tables) so we were led into the secondary dining area and it's a whole different world and not for us. We didn't order wine and my wife wasn't too hungry so only ordered a salad and a side dish, and the waitress didn't seem to be happy about that and didn't pay much attention to us. Also the bar area is calm and laid back but both dining are as loud as a high school cafeteria and for some reason no one even tries to keep their voices down. We could clearly identify voices from multiple tables across the room and it seemed to be normal. When my drink was gone she took it away and didn't ask if I wanted another. So no dessert for us, we ate and left. Would go back again, and put our foot down for the bar area, but not sure how much leverage we'll have with a $50 deposit on our reservation.......",2024-04-13T02:36:41.228Z,1,,32,FALSE,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,,,Dine in,2,5,2,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNXZmeVJBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfXxbrMT2XS0yT646HtlfWHzDOziQWXXVqQm_O=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,111242515582742126734,,,,
Galatoire's,3,"A disappointing experience all around. The service is inattentive and rests on their notoriety assuming everyone will just agree it‚Äôs amazing. We arrived for a 6:30 reservation and was told as we started to order that there was no crab available. Over half of their menu are crab based dishes. This seems to be a problem with sourcing and ensuring the restaurant is properly prepared to serve what‚Äôs on their menu. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller and were very disappointed. There were no bread crumbs to be found on these oysters, the spinach looked like someone dumped a can of goopy spinach on top, and they over baked the dish. I could bounce my fork off of the stiff spinach goop on top of the oyster. I waited for my waitress to ask how it was as we only ate two of them‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt ask, and when she came to remove them, I informed her they were not good. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my boss‚Äù and carried them away. The ‚Äúboss‚Äù did not come to check with us and they indeed did charge for them. The main entres were mediocre and nothing to rave about.

To add on, after the span of 5 seconds, the gravy from the roast beef quickly transferred to the bread and made it extremely soggy. Hence adding to its uneven texture. Not only that, the plates were dirty. The restaurant was also unable to record their orders properly, thus leaving my friends to starve and suffer as they watched everyone else eat. My friends and I then checked the reviews on the restaurants. They talked about recent food poisoning, and other liabilities. As soon as we read these reviews, it became clear that they were true. Finally, we would like to end with a warning; please do not come to this restaurant as the food does not taste good,  the restaurant does not practice hygiene, and is overall unsafe.",2024-04-22T20:48:34.306Z,3,,1,FALSE,,,a day ago,,,,,,,1,1,3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMGRUUlNBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,111803056328284727165,,,,

If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. The guy that it making sandwiches will do without gloves, a minute later he went out to smoke and come back to make more sandwiches without gloves or washing his hands.

The muffuletta was overage and low quality ingredients

The whole place looked dirty, it smelled horrible and the floor was sticky, itself is disgusting.

Gianna Restaurant,2,"We walked in and sat at the bar because we were told the earliest seat we could get was over 1.5hr wait. It‚Äôs a Thurs night and we had no reservation so that‚Äôs not unusual- sign of a good restaurant, right?

At no point while we were there (almost til 8) did the restaurant even approach 2/3 full. Maybe a bunch of no shows? Or maybe it‚Äôs because the food just wasn‚Äôt good.

We started with the Provola sausage appetizer that was OK, but tasted kind of lemony - maybe the oregano was just way too heavy? But the sausage definitely didn‚Äôt stand out.

Then, after over a 25 min wait including us promoting the bartender to check, I had spaghetti fra diavolo. I expect a little spice in fra diavolo, but it was pure black pepper that I tasted. No tomato, chili, basil or lemon. The shrimp were rubbery to boot. Did not finish. And we had paesano potatoes. The Parmesan was past the point of melting to nearly burnt on, there was no rosemary or garlic flavor. It didn‚Äôt even taste like it had salt or pepper (maybe they ran out after the spaghetti‚Ä¶).

And to top it off, the service was not good. We had to prompt them to check for our food after we had been sitting for 25 min. Generally when sitting at the bar, the bartender will check on your drinks to see if you like them - esp when one has an empty cocktail glass.

Golden Wall Restaurant,4,Ordered a combination platter of Moo Goo Gai Pan to share with my wife in our hotel room. Took about 20 minutes to walk back to the hotel. The eggroll was still warm and crispy. The food was still warm. Needed the extra soy sauce for the pork fried rice as it was a little bland. The MGGP was fresh with lots of chicken and a fair amount of celery which we picked out. We had leftover food even though we picked stuff out.

Trenasse,5,"Okay y'all, when I tell you I had my doubts.... They were absolutely unfounded.

This place was AMAZING. Everything, the food, service, ambiance, bathroom, and cocktails.

I brought my brunch bunch in this last Saturday for the bottomless deal. We had a 12 top and never wanted for a thing!

I was actually SURPRISED at how effective the mimos were, despite the fact that they mixed them for you (not my favorite thing and I had called ahead and was told they specifically DID NOT DO THIS, but it all turned out to be just fine).

Everything everyone ate was DEVINE. Not a single complaint to be had by my party of 12. That's quite a feat. I was having so much fun I didn't even get pictures of the food!

I had the boudin has, delicious but the star of the show (besides of course our AMAZING, SWEET, PATIENT, BUTT KICKING server, Tara ?I think)) was the crawfish pie. It was more like a pot pie, with poached eggs. Absolutely DELICIOUS. And sooooo my charbroiled oysters to choose from!

At some point there was gumbo and beignets too... Mmmm!

This place is right around the corner from my job and I will definitely be back! Thanks Trenasse!

Johnny S√°nchez,2,Decided to dine here on a Wednesday for a party of 12 and made prior reservations for 7:30. When we came into the restaurant our table wasn‚Äôt ready and the host seemed upset there were so many of us. Let me remind you it was a Wednesday and over half the tables were empty. I‚Äôm not sure if the host and server were judging us based on our age but the service was already lacking. Lily was our server and only took our orders and never came back. She checked on other tables but never came back to ours. There was a 20% auto gratuity but it seems unfair for us to be charged that when our server never came up to us but to take our order and payment.,2024-04-11T03:19:19.331Z,0,,4,FALSE,2024-04-12T02:27:55.845Z,,a week ago,,Dinner,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,2,3,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOGRpWnF3RRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,103241111868842078644,,,,

Thai Nola,5,"Would we return? Yes, absolutely

Traveling thru New Orleans, we were in search of a nice meal that was not a chain restaurant. Thai is one of our favorite ""genres"" of foods, so to speak.

A quick google search of restaurants near me yielded Thai Nola, and it had favorable images and reviews and a unique name.

This is a family-run restaurant, so that is a ++ in my book!

We had two Thai teas, which were very good, better than our local Thai place.

I ordered the Pad Thai medium spice, and it was actually the BEST Pad Thai plate that I have had! It had a great presentation, and wonderful flavor! Portion size VERY ample!

ORLEANS BROTHERS,5,"Visiting from Georgia with my husband whom is originally from east N.O and he loves Gumbo! A friend recommended for him to try this place besides his usual spot! Automatically we were impressed with how friendly they are because we pulled up a few minutes after closing! They treated us with the most respect and smile! 2nd, I would give them 10 stars for cleanliness! That made me feel really good because a lot of food places make you really pray over it!
Now here's the winner!! The Gumbo!! Since they were treating us like family, we shared the good news of why we were in town, celebrating  a birth! They gave my husband an extra container of Gumbo and glad they did! I told them I do not eat Gumbo but I'll taste some when we made it back to where we were staying! I was impressed and now I will say I will eat Gumbo but only from there and my husband really enjoyed his! We are suppose to leave but now will be here for a few more days so my husband said he's going back!!!
Of course I highly recommend this place!! Clean!!! Friendly!!! Delicious!!",2024-01-31T20:22:22.351Z,0,,4,FALSE,,,2 months ago,,,,,,Take out,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0MDZYQ0dBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,108544992339940239999,,,,

Felix's Restaurant & Oyster Bar,1,"We went to the Felix‚Äôs at the French Quarter the evening of 4/16/24. Not having been back to New Orleans for a few years, I was excited to return for the char grilled oysters. We have been multiple times in the past and the food has been great, and staff so friendly but unfortunately not this time. When arriving, there was an African American female hostess with glasses. Multiple tables were open but she told us we would have to wait for a 2 top table to be cleaned. We asked why we couldn‚Äôt sit at a 4 top, when she had seated other parties with 2 people at the 4 top tables. She smirked and refused to provide us with respond, instead just ignoring us. We made the decision to go elsewhere and when telling her same, she again just smirked as though she was proud of her actions. When we told the couple behind us of what happened, they also left the location and the hostess continued to smirk about her decision to treat us as she had. I made the mistake of calling the Lakefront location, instead of the French Quarter, and spoke to the supervisor. She was appalled by the fact an employee of Felix‚Äôs would treat customers as we were treated. She said the situation was totally mishandled and if it had been her location, she would have marched up front and made the situation right. She also recommended I write this review to advise the owner of what had happened. We have since left a voicemail for management, with no response but this type of customer service will keep me from returning. Instead, we went to Acme around the corner where the staff was friendly, food was great, service was efficient, and we weren‚Äôt discriminated against as we were by that hostess. Highly recommend Acme if you are in the area and looking for oysters and/or po boys!

Stumbled upon D√©j√† Vu while enjoying the French Quarter Festival and what a delightful surprise!

Luke,4,"The shrimp and grits here is amazing. The cheesy jalapeno grits made the dish with flavourful shrimp and sauce atop. The bone marrow was a bit disappointing in flavours. It needs some seasoning and refinement. My partner got the Bouillabaisse which looked great but we feel the dish needs rice instead of bread to really get that sauce. To end, we got the bread pudding which was delicious. I wish I stopped the waiter before he poured the entire serving of caramel sauce on top as I tend to prefer my desserts less sweet. Nonetheless it was great and the added pecans was a nice touch. I also tried the blackberry cocktail which was disappointing. The cocktail tasted alright but it was not cold enough and clearly had not been chilled or shaken with ice. I would skip the cocktails here. Service was friendly and attentive.

Luke,5,"Luke is a great little French restaurant situated in the Central Business District just south of French Quarter. My wife and I went for lunch and we decided to go all in and try a couple of traditional French items we had never had.

We ordered three items from the ""To Share"" section of the menu. Here's what we ordered:
1) Pat√™ of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Liver
2) Crispy Brussels Sprouts
3) Escargot & Bone Marrow
4) Saison du Pont (beer from Belgium)

I have to say, neither my wife nor myself enjoyed the pat√™. To be fair, this stuff looked legit. I'm confident this was excellent quality and it just turns out we aren't pat√™ people. The sprouts were fantastic and I was a huge fan of the accompanying sweet pepper sauce. Bone marrow is always amazing, and this was no exception. We enjoyed the escargot and it paired quite well with the marrow and the grilled bread served with the dish.

Service was excellent, food was great quality, and we were in and out pretty quickly.

We started with some cocktails that were pretty good, not too crazy. The entree platters were surprisingly big. I did not get to try them but my friends enjoyed. I had the gumbo and Peruvian scallop which were both tasty. Not wow, but good. 8.5/10. They also brought my friend a little dessert for her birthday which was so sweet!

M & J Soul Food Restaurant,4,"Stopped in with the hubby on the way to Maryland from Houston. We wanted to find a local place that was off the beaten path.

We were thoroughly impressed with our meal. I had the fried porkchops with candied yams and potato salad. The porkchops were humongous compared to what I'm used to and they were fried perfectly. The candied yams and mashed potato salad were both addictive.

The hubby had the seafood pasta, fried fish, and jambalaya. The pasta sauce was flavorful, but he was sad there wasn't more crab that was noticeable. However he did love the jambalaya and wished he had gotten a double helping of it instead of a salad.

Russell's Marina Grill,5,"Located in the heart of Lakeview, Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner stands as a cherished beacon of New Orleans‚Äô rich culinary tradition.

Since its inception in 1985, this diner has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to destination for exceptional breakfasts, weaving itself into the fabric of the city‚Äôs dining scene.

With a menu that spans the gamut from indulgent fried chicken and waffles to a diverse array of egg specialties, Russell‚Äôs caters to a broad spectrum of tastes.

Not forgetting the health-conscious, the diner also offers lighter fare such as eggwhite omelets and sweet potato pancakes, ensuring that every patron leaves satisfied.

The dining experience is further enhanced by the option to enjoy your meal either inside the diner‚Äôs cozy interior, at the counter where the local vibe thrives, in their inviting dining room, or outside on the pet-friendly patio, making it perfect for every occasion.

During my visit, I decided to try the legendary Egg Saints #33‚Äîa daring concoction that perfectly embodies New Orleans‚Äô flair for culinary innovation.

This dish features a grilled biscuit topped with alligator sausage, grilled tomatoes, poached eggs, and smothered in homemade country gravy.

Each component of the dish harmonizes to create a breakfast experience that is both unique and profoundly satisfying.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with the diner‚Äôs unmistakable local charm, enhanced by the friendly service that made me feel right at home.

The ambiance, a blend of the cozy and the communal, set the perfect stage for what was to be an unforgettable meal.

The Premier League playing softly in the background added a touch of camaraderie, reminiscent of a neighborhood caf√© where everyone is welcome.

The highlight of my visit was, without a doubt, the food.

The Egg Saints #33 was a revelation, transforming the classic eggs Benedict into a dish that captivated my palate and left me pondering the culinary prowess behind it.

Every bite was a testament to Russell‚Äôs commitment to quality and innovation, making it clear why this diner holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans‚Äô residents and visitors alike.

In a city lauded for its vibrant food scene, claiming the title of ""best breakfast"" is no small feat.

Yet, as I left Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner, I was already yearning to return and dive deeper into their menu.

This hidden gem is an absolute must-visit for anyone looking to experience the soul of New Orleans through its food, served with a side of unmatched hospitality.",2024-03-31T03:31:47.886Z,0,,56,TRUE,2024-04-04T07:20:02.272Z,,3 weeks ago,,Breakfast,,$10‚Äì20,,,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEOWZmbklREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf1he4U__AbJo9QGTtkJkxskJ205Z8Q3lNPNqI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEwMpD9wqMiJzOBUjXWd7m7Q6AybcVa6Z1UG7c=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2oxkwe263prXc55tCJ1kfLcEyVTDtluKK28Hb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWshm9NzIOQb5OpQ0oYa3o3dx8v7NWCCSs6YVV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,105956449935488145764,,,,

Also ordered the bun rieu and that was pretty good too although I prefer it without the fried shallots.,2023-04-11T15:39:12.899Z,0,,14,FALSE,,,a year ago,,,,$10‚Äì20,,Take out,4,4,4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdTg2QTRnRRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,118166188954861768583,,,,
