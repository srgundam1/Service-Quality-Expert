Chet's Dallas,4,"On the suggestion of a local resident, I visited Chet's during the busy Eclipse weekend in Dallas, and I'm glad I did. I sat at the bar and had a refreshing beer while deciding on a meal option. I eventually chose a burger, which was extremely tasty, and the bar chips it's served with were fresh and excellent. Several seated close by seemed to being enjoying their meals as well, with one commenting how tasty my burger looked . . . and it did.
The service at the bar (which was not overly busy) was only average, bordering on weak.  There wasn't much I needed, but I've appreciated that opportunity to order another drink.  The process to complete payment was a bit slow, but I was not in a rush at all, so that's OK.  I like the look of the place, and I do easily recommend it to others who might be in the area. Perhaps the service situation was a fluke this day.",2024-04-21T23:50:38.689Z,0,,588,TRUE,,,a day ago,,Lunch,,$20–30,Dine in,4,5,3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbnBDemdBRRAB,,,Google,,104294708585341754212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chick-fil-A,1,"One of my most disappointing experiences with Chick-fil-A occurred recently. Despite having placed numerous large catering orders at various locations in the past, I was shocked by the smaller size of my recent order and the multitude of issues it caused. I placed the order earlier in the day for pickup that evening on the 15th for a party. However, upon arriving at 7:45-7:50 for the 7:30 pickup window, my order was nowhere to be found. When I addressed the issue with the managers and team lead, I was met with a lack of care and attention. Overhearing the assistant general manager and a team lead speaking in Spanish (possibly assuming I didn't understand), I was dismayed to hear them dismiss the situation, claiming it wasn't a big deal because they hadn't seen my order. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, another team lead informed me that it would take another 15-20 minutes to thaw the bread for the sandwiches I ordered, or I could opt for wraps instead. Reluctantly, I agreed to change my order to expedite the process. Finally, an hour past the confirmed pickup time, I received my order, causing me to miss most of the party I was attending. All I received in return for this frustrating experience was an offer for a free milkshake or meal.",2024-04-16T19:33:39.875Z,0,,2,FALSE,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,$10–20,Take out,1,1,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa0tEbW9RRRAB,,,Google,,111234939746706455265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wing Bucket,1,Asked for a 4 piece combo. Was given the wrong order when I  asked specifically for wings and was given tenders. Tenders are soggy and flubbery in the middle. Unacceptable for a paying customer that left a tip. Cannot eat soggy tenders that I didn't ask for. Also skimped out on fries and gave me a half order. Was not given a drink until I asked. Saw the lady that took my order give herself and fill her cup too. Asked me specifically what I ordered for the 4 piece and I told her wings. She gave me tenders that I can't even eat. I feel this was deliberately done after I told her wings after she asked what kind of combo.server was named Daisy. Unacceptable for a customer that was a fan but won't he returning anymore unless I get a refund for the 20 dollars I spent for an incorrect order. They probably won't care anyways.

From the time I got in line to when I received my order of soup and salad — it was over 30 minutes. Pretty good lunch! The soup was very thick, (like stew) and spicy so I added some beef broth I had a my office. Today I tried the chicken salad. Not as good as the beef Barbados I had last time. They still do not have a very mild option on salsa. All of the salsa choices were hot. Still Very busy and seating was hard to come by. The line was about 10 people deep when I showed up just after 12 on a Wednesday for lunch. Employees are friendly but seemed overwhelmed both times. Go outside of lunch hours, if you can.

Grill & Vine,1,"We went to dinner at the Grill and Vine restaurant as a party of seven on April 8th. Five of the people were satisfied with their meal, but my daughter and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad, which was extremely sparse. It had virtually no quinoa, possibly one cut up apricot and one cut up cucumber and dressing that was advertised as curry, but tasted like pure oil. The kale was very hard and inedible. Each of us was charged $16 for our salads which amounted to $32. We were both extremely disappointed and upset but were hosting guests from out of town and did not want to complain or have to wait 20 minutes for new dinners if we ordered them. It was already a long wait to get our food originally. I am extremely upset and no one is getting back to me from management. My voicemail is sitting ignored. I offered to scan and send a copy of our receipt so they could give me a refund which be would be a small portion of what we spent  I am looking for a refund for those two salads .Wish me luck. By the way, the atmosphere was lovely and our server Alfredo was great.

Grill & Vine,1,"I visited Grill and Vine at the Westin Downtown Dallas and had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food and menu items were subpar, my server didn’t know in-depth about any items on the menu, but those things were not a big deal. When my check comes for $220, I give my card and the server comes back saying that only $160 was deducted and that I still owe the additional $60. So I check my account, things are all good so I give back my card to charge the rest. They then charge me an additional $180 and are saying I still owe more money. Seeing that I’ve already been charged $340 for a $220 bill I immediately go to the manager bc it makes no sense whatsoever. The manager proceeds to tell me that the card reader automatically charged the amount of $180 and he doesn’t know why. In what world does a card reader charge random amounts? You would have to type in the amount owed to be charged.

While trying to see what’s going on and get my money back, Louis Almassy comes over and immediately tells me to calm down, calls me aggressive, and threatens to call the authorities on me without even knowing what’s going on or why I’m upset about being overcharged. He continued to call me aggressive and threatened to call the cops on me all for being upset about money being taken from me. I didn’t appreciate being called names and being threatened with cops for simply just calling out being overcharged.

I truly believe that I was only threatened with the cops being called because I’m black as there was nothing happening that warranted a cop being involved when again, money was taken from ME. Louis saw a black man upset and immediately pegged me as the problem without even getting an understanding of the situation. Even after getting an understanding, he never apologized for threatening to call the cops.

Furthermore, Louis is a loss prevention manager which “protects a company's assets from fraud and theft”, why would I be reprimanded by him when I’m the one in need of help? This dining experience was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had.",2024-02-15T16:12:46.564Z,0,,1,FALSE,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,1,3,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkZ2Fqcll3EAE,,,Google,,114341563465172989245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grill & Vine,1,"I booked this venue for Valentine’s Day with my wife. $85 per person is reasonable so I booked it. We were greeted promptly and politely by the hostess. The restaurant was basically empty, which made me wonder why the booking time was so limited. It took a few minutes to be greeted and offered drinks, but the bar was busy so we understood. When we placed our order, we watched our drinks sit on the bar for 8 minutes before my wife got up and got them for us. When it came time to order from the fixed menu, I was concerned when they didn’t ask what temperature I wanted my filet. Come to find out, it’s only well done. They brought out my plate with mushrooms, some sort of potato, and a thin filet cooked WELL DONE. It was painfully obvious the steak was premade and microwaved to order. My wife got scallops and risotto, the scallops had a strong fishy smell to them, which is NOT in the norm. I sent my steak back to be prepared medium rare as a filet should be. The product they returned to me was BLUE RARE at best. At this point, I was annoyed. So I asked them to return the food and bring us our check. I gladly paid for my wife’s meal since she tolerated the scallops. The oxtail pie appetizer was bland, and the cappuccino tomato soup starter was good, but was maybe an ounce. To top it off, they brought h wife her dessert and sent back mine since I returned my meal, and requested it to be removed (I took one bite of my well done steak). While I understand they shouldn’t just hand stuff out, they should have at least made an effort to remedy the poor food quality. I don’t blame the server at all. Either way, I paid $113 for my wife’s meal that was mediocre at best. The risotto was bland and overcooked along with the overly fishy scallops. I hope management fixes this for future diners.

I guess the good thing about the oxtails is, they were really tender, which did allow me to pull the meat off the bones and add some seasonings. I can understand being cautious about salt levels, but at least put a little. Also, it never hurts to taste the food before putting it out as well. 🙂",2021-08-08T19:28:42.393Z,0,,4,FALSE,,,2 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhNDdYMm5nRRAB,,,Google,,114193181851628332271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parker is so lovely! A complete sweetheart and just an amazing bartender.

But there’s this other bartender who is an immigrant and so ashamed to speak or be spoken to in Spanish. The self hate is saddening. It’s degrading. He’s Venezuelan and looks down on being spoken to in Spanish. I’m a U.S. born citizen who embraces the language. Why act like I’m degrading you by speaking a language that establishes commonality?

Do you want to cater to one race, ethnicity or nationality of people in the USA? The country that is the melting pot of the world??? I’m so disgusted right now!!! Elitism is intolerable in all forms.

Henry's Majestic,1,"Henry's Majestic: A Disaster From Start to Finish

Starving after Church, Service Left Us Praying for Salvation

We arrived at Henry's Majestic with high hopes after hearing good things, only to be met with a nightmare of a dining experience. Let's just say our Easter celebration went from holy to ""holy moly, this place is bad!""

Reservations Don't Mean Reservations

Despite having a reservation, our party of ten (including restless kids) waited a soul-crushing **hour and a half** for our food. By the time it arrived, we were famished and past the point of polite conversation.

A Sticky Situation (Literally)

A quick trip to the men's room did little to improve our mood. The floor was a disgusting tribute to those who came before us, leaving a lingering question about the overall cleanliness of the establishment.

Food? More Like a Food Quest

The agonizing wait for our entrees wasn't the end of the saga. After finally getting our food, it took another **45 minutes** just to receive a measly dessert.  Apparently, patience is a key ingredient at Henry's Majestic, because you'll need it in biblical proportions.

The Kitchen Gods Said ""No"" to My Friend's Meal

One member of our party never even received their dinner! Two whole hours vanished, and poof, no food appeared. The waiter's excuse of a ""busy Easter rush"" was laughable considering we had reservations. Shouldn't they have been prepared for a holiday crowd?

The Service? Non-Existent

Our waiter, Sam, tried his best, but  it wasn't enough to salvage this disaster.  There were no apologies, no attempt to fix the situation, just an acceptance of defeat.

The Last Supper (We Wish!)

This experience left a worse taste in our mouths than last year's fruitcake. Henry's Majestic is a place we'll be avoiding like the plague.

Jack Ruby's Saloon and Grill,2,"Very disappointing experience at this restaurant. My family was visiting from out of town and heard good things about this place. We walked in after spending the morning at the Dallas aquarium. We ordered a burger, wedge salad, hot dog, and chicken sandwich. It took about an hour for all our food to come out and at three separate times. My son’s burger was brought out first (by mistake from another table’s order) and our server ended up saying he could keep it and our food would be out shortly. About 20 minutes later by the time my son was finished my salad arrived. We were still missing my husband and daughter’s food. I went ahead and ate my salad and when I was finishing my lunch the rest of the food arrived. This was about 45 minutes after our order had been placed and the restaurant was not busy by any means. The hot dog had mustard on it which we had told the server to omit when we placed our order. When asked if we could get a new hot dog with just ketchup as originally ordered and keep the fries (our daughter was so hungry at this point) the server seemed annoyed. She brought us a new hot dog within a few minutes…drowning in ketchup, about 3 times the amount that was on the original hot dog, looking sloppy and gross overall. They were clearly annoyed we had requested a new one. This place has a fun overall bar atmosphere and an area for a live band. Maybe for a night out drinking it’s great but for a family meal they totally missed the mark.",2024-03-15T20:19:18.342Z,0,,11,FALSE,2024-03-20T01:20:32.973Z,,a month ago,,,,,,2,2,2,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dXNXWENnEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOnZ3wBOc_hJ57S8jgGW57_cRGFKpQfFb6SCdI=w150-h150-k-no-p,,Google,,103409375872203004332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,1,My honey lemon pepper wings were undercooked completely!!! (Red center).. and the fries were overcooked completely and cold!! (Almost like biting into a potato chip).. and the sweet tea tasted like it had more water than tea!! But they did give me plenty utensils and condiments 🤷🏽‍♀️.  Hopefully when employees start being replaced with robots then this establishment will be in the top 5 to start with…. I’m not basing this review off of 1 visit to this place… this is the 3rd and final visit! Each time the order was under or overcooked! Or stale! Or you’ll attempt to order chicken at 10 (they close at 11) and they’ll say they don’t have any chicken or fish left!!! Well why are you open? You don’t sell burgers!!!

Then he takes our order, my husband orders a blue moon beer, nothing fancy, the bartender proceeds to take two other tables who came in after us, their blue moons. My husband had to go to the bar and ask the guy for his beer. When our food came, I asked for a  seedless bun for my turkey burger, and what do I get.. a BUN FULL OF POPPY SEEDS.

Buena Vista Restaurant & Club,2,"I have been driving past this restaurant for over 20 years, ever since I moved to the area. I had been planning on trying it for some time. Well, my son and I finally found the time and stopped in.I have been trying to find something positive to say about my experience at the Buena Vista restaurant. The only thing that I could come up with is the staff was very friendly. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with the food. My son ordered the beef fajitas, they were pretty flavorless. Not even any salt or pepper. I tried the grilled chicken. It was dry and tough. My meal also came with a sour cream chicken enchilada. The enchilada was hard with minimal sauce. But the staff was very friendly. They came by numerous times to check on us but I didn't know how to explain why the food was so unappetizing. When we received the bill it was for over $50 plus tip. Neither my son nor I had any alcohol. We do not drink. He had a soft drink and I had a tea.

Taco Bell,1,I don't even write reviews. I don't have the time for that mess but imma surely make time for this one. First of all it's tacobell there's no real expectation for fast food. Still when you can't even throw some beans and cheese on a tortilright there's some issues. That definitely needs to be addressed. All I wanted was a few simple burritos. And what I got was that crap I ordered a chicken enchilada burrito and I only got a few small slivers of chicken. I don't understand how that passes as a proper made chicken enchiladas burrito. Especially given the fact you have a menu to guide you and a specific measurement scoop to give the exact amount everytime.that is wrong and disrespectful in so many levels.look I get it it i really do sometimes you just may not have the right amount to make the proper portion of an item pulled or maybe just out of stock. But that don't mean that you can make a person believe that they will be getting what they ordered. All I got was a rice and cheese with red sauce burrito. you couldve just said we dont have that item available at this time not make people pay for it anyway. You took my money and just slapped crap into a tortilla knowing thats not at all what i paid for WRONG AND UNPROFESSIONAL. There's a difference of making mistakes and just down right not doing it right just because you just dont care. If your gonna do it do it right or not at all not a recommended  place to eat at,2024-03-06T05:02:33.069Z,0,,4,FALSE,,,a month ago,,,,$1–10,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5X3VTcXdBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgqWN-jI5NIpmiqfycWRaWRFTqGiNh4OmGO4dx=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,103543821808523611488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chicken Express,1,"I was just up there and whoever the manager was (male) does not have the customer in mind.  Every time I come up there, I’m interrupted while I’m giving my order through the drive thru which results in my order being WRONG. I told the person today to STOP TALKING and let me finish my order.  The manager then got on and told me not to talk to his people that way.  He then tried to sell me a pie and told me it might cheer me up. LOL.
Guess what….YOU STILL GOT MY ORDER WRONG.   YOU GET MY ORDER WRONG EVERY SINGLE TIME I’M UP THERE.  It’s because the people working the drive thru DO NOT LISTEN.  You handed me my food and then you wanted me to PARK for the rest of my order which was DRINKS. REALLY???  Park for drinks??  I will be contacting the corporate office and will let them know the horrible service and people that are working there.  It’s unbelievable.

Pizza Hut,1,"By far my worst experience with any pizza hut. We accepted the 1 hour wait time. When the delivery guy (later identified as a PH worker vs door dash per the store worker after calling back) came, we were given 2 boxes and a wings container. One pizza box was entirely EMPTY! Who in their right mind seals an empty box and then also doesn't notice how EMPTY it feels?

After calling back. The worker offered to either get a redelivery (an extra hour wait 😤) or store credit. The 1 star given was for the store worker who offered a credit in an amount more than the product that we ordered, which is fair due to the inconvenience and hunger my family endured after not receiving the amount of food we prepared for. Thank you store worker for making it a bit better and for apologizing on behalf of the business.

Wendy's,1,"Upon meeting the main Manager MITCH.  I was met with
hostility.
There's a severe lack of leadership in this
place. I've been to this place for 20 yrs or more but
it's gone downhill. No lobby open to the public.
The
mgr is confrontational. No teaching, training or
motivating the workers. No ethical practices. No I
won't be supporting this restaurant until there's
changes for the better by hiring general managers
who take care of their employees and give
opportunities to better themselves.

How you can hire someone with a disability and then work them a million hours and because there's a complaint,  And you have a million complaints even before this especially on Yourself, which YOU failed to inquire about from the person it's against, or even TRY to provide additional training, YOU SUCK AS A LEADER! And then to just remove them without even a conversation refusing to answer calls or texts and even a courtesy to let them go.
You are a weak cowardly person who doesn't deserve the title of Manager.
To be hostile and not hear the concerns of the guardian is even worse. You didn't do me a favor by coming over and ""allowing"" me to sit in the locked down lobby.

I'd love to have a conversation with the owner of this place regarding American disability Act!
Better yourself and Take a Class!

I had a gordita with chicharrón en salsa verde while waiting for my huitlacoche quesadilla. The gordita was light tasting with a slight crunch  but filled with chicharrón and cotija cheese.

Church's Texas Chicken,1,I went to get something for my wife and when i went through the drive through i wasnt greeted and i had to drive to the window to see both employees in the front window having a conversation with a customer who was waiting on his order.

It's always 'this chicken is good, but it's not as good as Pollo Regio.' I am grateful to Emma and Angie because they make it a wonderful experience when we come by, and we have come by 3 or 4 times a week when we are working in town because the food is that good and the atmosphere is so inviting.

Lots of time even in the mornings they are out of most breakfast items. Anyways I went ahead and got the #7 Buttery Jack with curly fries. Get to the window and the young man was not hateful, but not welcoming. There were a few young ladies in there all laughing and talking loud, music being played very loud. The atmosphere was almost like you weren't wanted & were an inconvenience to them. But the food, the meat is hard, cold not warm at all, and the fries are cold and so hard you can hardly chew them. The only thing worth having was the Dr.Pepper I got. I will never go back to this location again. I paid almost $14 just to have to go down the street to Whataburger and pay for something else.

Buffalo Wild Wings ‘GO’,1,I rated this place low unfortunately because of a disrespectful lying manager (Hispanic decent) and her disrespectful co-worker (white lady who thinks she is black). I mentioned their race for a reason. I had a pick up order. Grabbed my food and opened the bag to see if the fries was cold because order was done at 3:00 I walked in at 3:06. While opening the bag the employee was giving me a dirty look so I said I’m just trying to see if my fries are hot. She then says you good we just put it up there. I continued with checking and just as I thought they were cold. I POLITELY said ma’am may I please have a fresh order of fries. She rolled her eyes and said they are fresh. I politely said no they are not. She takes the fries I take a seat. The manager comes over and says they can’t give me fresh fries because the order was fine. I tell the manager I just tasted it and it’s cold and since I paid for it want them hot. The manger continues to be defiant and disrespectful. I said I’m not leaving without hot fries. The employee brings new fries (I’m sure she just redropped but whatever I don’t care they hot. I ask for DM manger number. They gave a card. I go to the car call the number and the manger who I just got into it with answered. Now this lady lied and assured me it was the right number. All of this was unnecessary and stupid. They only had to give me fresh fries that’s it. Turned into a real situation and if I wasn’t smart with self control things could have went left. I’m still going to file that complaint! No one should have to deal with foolish people when all I wanted was some wings and fries.

Seafood City Restaurant,2,"I was very hesitant to try this place because of the bad reviews I saw; at the same time I want to try it for myself and see for myself. First impression: a very old & dirty fried chicken restaurant, a step down from Lisa’s Chicken. The price is relatively fair, quite competitive to other fried chicken places. I was able to get a 3pc chicken dinner (2 sides) and a “medium” drink for under $10. The chicken tasted very bland, very greasy and left a bad after taste. I believe they’ve used rotten chicken to fry, very gross, and don’t even get me started with their soggy fries I couldn’t even finish. The drink is not up to its size. I got the medium one ($1.59) and it is very clearly not 24 oz as advertised. It is more like 16 oz. They fill it up with ice so you don’t get the full volume of drink, and they would charge you 50 cents for refill. Because of how this restaurant offers dirt poor quality of food, I was going to give it a 1-star review. However, an extra star rating was given by me because they let me get the refill for free.

Salad and Go,1,"I’ve only been here 3 times and 2 out of those 3 times they’ve gotten my order wrong. Even after specifying and having my order read back to me. I just started coming here last week..so 2/3 times of getting messed up orders is really bad. I can only imagine how many orders they get wrong on a usual if I’ve managed to get 2 times in just the last 4 days. AND THEN THEY DONT ANSWER THE PHONE! You’re told to leave a voicemail but I’ve now ordered this food today and still haven’t received a callback from the first incident the last time I came. The first time we specified no bacon on one of the wraps…we specified why and asked that the bacon be placed on the side to be given to my dog…the bacon was on the side and everywhere in the wrap despite asking specifically for no bacon in the wrap. This time we have a very similar situation but this time, the bacon  isn’t here at all. I asked for it on the side again, and now it’s missing completely. I’ve not been able to check the wraps to make sure they didn’t put it there as well, I will do that and update if needed but this is crazy. And the fact that I have to drive all the way back up there to rectify it because they don’t answer the phone OR I have to simply eat my money and not get what I paid for. I drove back the first time, I’m not doing it this time. If I decide to continue eating at this place at all, I’ll definitely just make take the extra 20 minutes and drive to the one on hulen st. Staff is much more friendly and you can bet your food  will be right. I’ve never had an issue.

UPDATE: YET AGAIN THE WRAP  ITSELF WAS ALSO FILLED WITH BACON. I drove all the way back around 8:45 pm.  I ordered around 4pm and let them know about the messed up Mordor around 3:15/339. Literally opened it and picked the bacon out at the drive through.  I did end  up getting my whole order refunded because this is ridiculous, we have to now go to a whole
Different place to eat because you guys are to incompetent to follow a basic order. NO BACON is like as basic as it gets..how do you mess that u? You rush me through ordering as if you just have it all together just to not get the order right still!! If you’re going to rush me when ordering then  at least get my order right.

Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers,4,The day previous to this review I went and got the Caniac to go and when I got to work it was short 2 pieces of chicken. Called and they immediately said come back and we'll make it right. Now the reason I decided to make the review is due to the manager who stepped in when I got there today. Some managers and fast food establishments like to stand around and make themselves look important at times. Jy however evidently is more concerned about customer service and correcting errors that his team caused. He didn't just say make the food for me he did it himself to make sure it was done right. That's some pretty good customer service and a way to step up to show how important customer service should be to everybody.

Chick-fil-A,3,"Came here today for a carry out order for a grilled chicken club sandwich.

Got the order and checked it for quantity and it looks good.

Got home and we discovered that the ""chicken"" did not make it into the container!!! I've had multiple mishaps (about 60%) from this location ranging from missing sandwiches, missing GF buns, and missing items - most of these I've actually let go. They do get it right sometimes and I do what I can to check the order to prevent it at the counter.

However, to have to open individual containers to make sure the chicken was there is going too bit much babysitting. We should expect a certain amount of quality. And the place wasn't even that busy today... The drive thru wasn't long and the dining area was not full.
