"I am saddened that I have to give this restaurant a poor rating because the customer service was excellent. The young lady at the counter was very polite and professional. However, the rib sandwich that I ordered was absolutely terrible. The ribs were small they were dry and hard for the price that I paid $10.89. I got three very small bones. So the rating that I‚Äôm given is not for the customer service it is most definitely a rating of a 2 rating of 1 to 10 on the item and a 10 on the Customer service. This was my first time so I do plan to revisit to try one of the other items to give it a second chance. However, after this time if the item isn‚Äôt good I will not go back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsaTdYY3dBRRAB,Atlanta,en

"I live on this side of town and have never tried Stems so I decided to try it out while supporting a black owned business. I ordered the 3 wing breakfast ($11.50 + tax) and a side salmon patty ($5 + tax).

3 wing breakfast: OK - comes with grits and eggs (scrambled), with choice of toast or biscuit. Eggs were light and fluffy but, grits were undercooked and very ""gritty"" along with 3 very small lightly seasoned wings.

Salmon: Horrible - appears to be a precooked frozen patty which was spicy and dry. Definitely not like any fried Salmon patty I've ever had.

All in all, the staff was friendly but I didn't care for the food bought today. I may try other dishes in the future.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMElEaHdBRRAB,Atlanta,en

"Really nice atmosphere. All the staff were nice. I went during lunch time on a Friday and it was not crowded at all. It‚Äôs a small space but doesn‚Äôt feel cramped. The menu is not higher but it has great options that are outside of the box. I enjoyed my
Appetizer and entree. The dessert was okay and the parking is not very convenient.

The sever did a great job with recommending wine pairings with our food.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqM3VTVlFnEAE,Atlanta,en
"I was thrilled to visit this restaurant for my birthday as it appeared *perfect* for me with the upscale dining experience + books pair. While the service and environment did not disappoint, the food did. It all tasted pretty good, and presented nicely, however the portion sizes were appalling for the prices. The server said the plates are meant to be shared, so we ordered more dishes than we originally intended to. But when you order a plate for $45 and only get three Brussels sprouts to ‚Äúshare,‚Äù you feel robbed. After spending more $200 total, we were not even full when we left.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqOXRHU1B3EAE,Atlanta,en
"This is maybe the best restaurant I've been to in years. It excells in all categories, but especially the food. I'm still craving the omelet.

"Overall, we had a good experience! Food was good. My drink was good. Definitely bougie in all areas. Book options were low.. coffee table and cookbooks that were price range from $50 and up. Was wishing to bring home a cozy read for the afternoon. Also, wasn‚Äôt super cozy, very corporate buckhead. Could be really good for a business lunch.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURELXJTNkx3EAE,Atlanta,en
"This experience was underwhelming and expensive for the price. Although it is marketed to be a book store, you can't really look at the books and you're not allowed your laptops at the bar in the case you want to have a drink and work. The hostess wasn't going to seat me at first and then decided she did have an empty seat at the bar for a couple hours and I felt a bit of judgement passed since I was alone. And on that note, bar requires reservations. Food was mediocre and overpriced. It just ultimately seemed like based on how you were dressed and how you looked, you may get better service than others.  The bartender however was very nice and knowledgable on wine.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaUo2djlnRRAB,Atlanta,en
"Nestled in the heart of Buckhead. This sophisticated literary experience of dining is tasteful and quaint. Lucian offered a wonderful dining experience while surrounded by exquisite coffee table books. Eddie offered supreme service with suggestions from the menu. The steak was like butter, melting at every bite. The oysters were fresh and adorned a refreshing hint of pear. The Chocolate Budino topped with Pistachios rounded out the meal superbly.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNELW95V2Z3EAE,Atlanta,en

"Walked in to treat myself to a nice cocktail and a small bite. The look of the restaurant is beautiful and intimate. Great for a drink at the bar with a book or for a date. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with recommending a cocktail and food. She suggested a delicious yuzu cocktail that I had with an amazing custard dessert that was decorated with glazed pears and other fruit.
I enjoyed sitting at the bar and talking with the staff who were very helpful on recommending great dishes and delivering excellent service.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkOGFiVTN3RRAB,Atlanta,en
"I‚Äôve been here for lunch and dinner. Google restricts my review to one meal (at least for photos and menu items) but I‚Äôd love to share my experiences of both.

My latest visit was for lunch. This is one of the most underrated lunch experiences in Atlanta. The atmosphere is light, airy, casual but elevated/sophisticated. Menu seems unassuming but has some absolute knockouts. Service was also just really enjoyable; I‚Äôm not much of a conversationalist but had Caroline at the bar and ended up having one of the best restaurant chats in recent memory, and was guided through the menu for an awesome selection of the omelette, sticky toffee pudding, and coffee.

Dinners are more intimate, and a little hard to get a reservation so it‚Äôs been tough for my schedule. Unsure how a group reservation would go but can vouch for solo trips and dates, or close 1:1 catch ups. Despite the reservation struggles, I appreciate the smaller seating capacity and streamlined menu. I suppose I‚Äôd like more small bite options to pair with the wine because I always end up getting the Jam√≥n Ib√©rico and would like more meats, but that‚Äôs knit pick.

I‚Äôll end with a confirmation that the book store element is not a gimmick and not aesthetics only - the curation is so well done. I‚Äôve gotten 5 books as gifts and 2 for myself.

Really appreciate this spot. Atlanta could use more spaces like this that execute on the actual food experience as well as they do in the creativity and vibe.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkX3N5MnpnRRAB,Atlanta,en

"Had dinner there the other night; no reservation but was promptly seated. The atmosphere is very nice, and the music selection was good for me, as it was mainly 90s and early 00s. It was also played at a nice, audible-but-not-intrusive level. My partner and I could easily hear each other talk. The service was great, and our server was very patient and knowledgeable about the whole menu. He also gave good recommendations.
The food was amazing. Best tofu I've had in years. The duck was great, and the corn fritters were good. All the fried foods were light, not greasy and heavy, and tasted like they used clean oil. The drinks were good, and reasonably priced. Actually, everything was reasonably priced because we had about 10 things and the bill was on par for a business lunch for us, even though it was a nice dinner.

We will definitely be back soon.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEaUxTT053EAE,Atlanta,en
"Planned to meet with a group and some members of our party arrived much later than planned. Regardless, the service was excellent, food and drinks were prompt and excellent.

For the appetizer, we had the small tasting plate with corn fritters, kreme crispy chicken and pork wonton. The crispy chicken was my favorite, it was crunchy and still juicy, just perfection. The shrimp crackers they give are also really good along with the sauce. For the mains there was a mixture of lamb, beef and chicken ordered and everyone enjoyed their meals and accompanying drinks.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5N1lqZkxBEAE,Atlanta,en

It wasn‚Äôt busy yet our order was delayed, any seared pieces that would have been great if they were ‚Äújust seared‚Äù were now room temp; better quality than your average sushi spot, but not high end, and not worth going all out. Maybe a working ac would have helped the kitchen/chefs out a bit.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENmJMRzBRRRAB,Atlanta,en
"Had a wonderful experience here. We had 16 course omakase tasting, and added few additional pieces right before desserts. Every single course was beautiful and delicious. Especially the design of plates/objets went perfect with each piece. For some of them, I felt like I was looking an contemporary art! Chef was super professional(Sorry I forgot to ask your name, you were the best) and provided enough(but not too complicated) explanations for us.

For drinks, welcome drink was amazing lovely. Crafted cocktail was bit strong and too flavourful to me. Not balanced. I also ordered sake flights, which was the best choice. Portion of sake was not much, nor
little. Server explained/recommended each sake and told us which sake would go well for each dish. We told them we're celebrating PHD defense, and they put small congrats graduate decor for our dessert. Gift after the course was also quite impressive - a sweet treat and teabag. We had to wait about 20 minutes because other people came late, but I was not angry as the chef/server explained and apologized enough.

Overall satisfied. Definitely will come again to try 25 course.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEc28zUFR3EAE,Atlanta,en
"My wife and I came to brush for dinner after our wedding. We were excited to try the tasting menu and it did not disappoint.

Thank you to Brush for making our meal so memorable.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdFBfZmdnRRAB,Atlanta,en
"Having tried thoroughly enjoyed our omakase experiences at Mujo and Hiyakawa we have been trying to find other similar experiences in Atlanta. I am happy to report that Brush's omakase did not disappoint. The service was outstanding. Both the servers and the chef spent generous amounts of time talking with us and making sure we had everything we needed/wanted.

We did the 16 course menu and it was the perfect amount a food and I would say it is a better value when compared to Mujo or Hiyakawa. I would say the atmosphere sits in between those two. Mujo having a very chill comfortable vibe and Hiyakawa being more like a museum and culinary course. At Brush you get a more chill vibe and can get as little or as much information you want to the meal. I would also say that Brush is much less overbearing on the rules than either Mujo and Hiyakawa which was very nice.

The quality of the fish and dishes were amazing. Brush has a unique rice and some unique presentations that the other places don't have. All things considered I think Brush my be the best overall place (accounting for price, comfort and experience).

The only draw back of the omakase experience for me is the the space in not an intimate as the other spots I have mentioned. You can definitely tell you are in Buckhead.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5bWRfU1JnEAE,Atlanta,en

We came for a special occasion and sat at the bar with Angel, who was a lovely guide to our meal and helped us choose some delicious sake. We began with the dry-aged fish tasting - fresh and delicious. Then we enjoyed both the caviar and o-toro service, both of which exceeded expectations.

We were greeted by a very kind hostess who took our coats and led us to the bar while we waited for our sever- the bar was attentive, quick and very friendly even offering suggestions based on our usual drink types. Our server came to greet us at the bar and walked us to the Omakase area which was so beautiful ‚Äî the details of the restaurant were just perfect.

Once we sat down our server went over the drink pairing with us and we opted to let him choose for us throughout the dinner (excellent decision). The chef came out to greet us and immediately started preparing fresh wasabi and getting right into the meal.

The food was delicious. They have a unique sushi experience with dry aging the fish. We were able to compare fresh and dry aged of multiple types and then moved on to Nigiri (and wow this was my favorite part). Everything we ate was delicious and we left very satisfied and will be back.

We didn‚Äôt take many photos as we were living in the moment but this place needs to be added to your must try date night spots ASAP.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNE5EeGxnRRAB,Atlanta,en

I found her to be quite rude and condescending as she was explaining the menu, which I told her that I had already looked at online to familiarize myself with. Im already familiar with vegan cuisine, which I‚Äôve been eating and preparing since the 1980s. I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of cultural appropriation going on here and that‚Äôs not cool either but be that as it may, someone needs cultural/ethnic sensitivity training to go along with the food.

The only positive part of the night was the DJ. To get a seat, they force you to spend $300 on a cheap bottle. The area is also small.

"Ok I won't fault the place for the environment. It is more geared for the younger crowd or someone into a more excitable scene. The music, the hookah, and drinks along with the occasional weed smoking is definitely for a specific crowd. Now when it comes to the food, I give that full 5 stars. I was impressed. I had the lobster sliders with the salmon bites as an appetizer. They were AMAZING. The sauce, ugh I could not stop dipping my fries in. I was drawn to this place because of a Google search and the pictures of the food looked great. Now when you actually try it..... . The chef that day deserves a raise. The bun the lobster sliders were on was not hard, but like crisp and soft. The lobster was not chewy or felt over cooked. It was just right.

"If you want over priced food go here. If you want overpriced drinks go here! After a night at the club we decided to keep the moment going. From the outside this place looks amazing however looks can be deceiving.  It‚Äôs 3:30 am on a Thursday night when I heard the lady said its $80 for entry (I actually chuckled and said to myself this is not Vegas ) however I was with a group who already had a section so I wasn‚Äôt worried about a price . The lady then claims that the  group inside already has the maximum amount of people in the section ( 4 ) and it will be extra for any additional people cool,  it was handled by the men we were with. Upon entry I was hit with a very foul smell, it literally smelled like sewage however once we went up into like this jungle blue area the smell was no more. Once we got to the section the drinks came and they were poured into Flask (I guess to prevent people from throwing the bottles idk why ) but heres the biggest red flag!  I could taste the alcohol and tell that this was not the brand actual liquor it‚Äôs fake version. I was actually shocked that such an established would try to deceive people . I guess they expect people to be too high to even notice lol but I was pissed although I wasn‚Äôt even the one paying. For  10 wings it cost $36 dollars the most I‚Äôve seen for wings since I‚Äôve to ATL .

Especially panner tikka, malai kofta was wayyyyy too sweet (my kids kept saying the food smelled like shrikhand like indian sweet) Also server never asked us for the spice level we would like to have. So it was very mild in spice level and that‚Äôs not what we wanted.
Their food is very very expensive, almost a double of what we usually pay at other Indian restaurants. But we knew that before going there. Wanted to try once. And it‚Äôs a last for us. Not because of the money but because of the way food taste, it‚Äôs not worth the money for us.  Other than that it‚Äôs a good place.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOWZmcmZBEAE,Atlanta,en

"This is our one of the favorite Indian food restaurant in Atlanta and it‚Äôs on the top of the list. We come here to celebrate special occasions.

Yesterday, we ordered some dishes that we have never tried here before.

Kurkuri Bhindi was perfect and excellent.

Paneer Vindaloo was as expected spicy but we couldn‚Äôt stop eating it until it was finished.

We requested some food without onion and garlic (I know some of you will ) My wife doesn‚Äôt eat them and we were given couple of choices and she picked Paneer Saag and Daal Tadka. They were both good.

Masal soda Limca and Chilli mango mojito were spot on.

Why 4/5 stars? Roomali Roti was little less warm, almost on cold side and that makes it not so pleasant. Otherwise, everything else was perfect.

Staff is always at their best, making sure the guests feels they are special and satisfied.

Ambience and location draws us here over and over again.

Until next celebration, we will cherish this visit.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0c3ZuNTNBRRAB,Atlanta,en

Went for an office dinner with colleagues. Interesting and tasty menu items. Good choices on alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages.

Ambience and atmosphere is simple. Spacious. When we went it was less crowded. Service speed is ok. Update: when crowded, it becomes very noisy- difficult to have decent business conversations due to close proximity of seats.

I gave one less star - we ordered whole wheat paratha - which was bit flaky than soft. Rest of dishes were good in taste and quantities.

"Great location and parking option. Greet staff was great. Once seated, the time for beverages and placing our order was acceptable, but it plummeted downhill from there. The waitress is the reason for the negativity of this experience. She was very inattentive.  Everything we received was only after continually flagging her down and asking for it. The wait time for the food was unacceptable, but then there was an additional four minutes of waiting for silverware in order to partake in the food that took forever to get there. The young man who busted the tables was extremely pleasant, personable & commendable. I actually tried to give him the tip, but he stated he was not allowed to accept it.  He definitely was deserving of it. There were four of us in the party, and everyone enjoyed their food except for The Floridian omelette, either the crab meat or the sauce was spoiled and it ruined the entire dish.

"This post was made solely for the sake of the desserts. Whoever you have back there in pastry are putting their hearts and souls into these sweets.

I enjoyed a pistachio cupcake, and my lover a tiramisu. I, upon biting into the middle of the cupcake, took a second to process whether or not this texture was real. The sponge was incredibly soft and fluffy, aerated and moist. The pistachio flavor was present, but subtle. Accompanied by what may have been the finest cream cheese icing I‚Äôve consumed in my life. Candied pistachio pieces scattered on top made for the finest delicacy I‚Äôve had in a while. Simple ‚Äî executed perfectly.

As for the tiramisu, I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve historically been a fan of them (too bitter), so my notes on them are notably less. My companion, upon first bite, immediately remarked that it was ‚Äúvery good‚Äù with the bite still in his mouth. I found it to be very soft and creamy, with a present but not too powerful taste of espresso. The ladyfingers were soft and crumbly; the whipped topping a cloud resting on my tongue. My only note is that the overall texture was very monotone. I think a crunchier ladyfinger would lend some liveliness to the dish.

But yes, phenomenal desserts that deserve a special review and shoutout! ",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeHNHOXR3RRAB,Atlanta,en

"Update- Went to Pricci‚Äôs tonight for dinner for a return visit.

FABULOUS.

Had a calf liver starter with grits that was outstanding. The Fritto Misto was delicious- just the right amount of breading and lightly fried.  The veal chop was remarkable. It was perfect. My dinner guest had the pasta with shrimp, which was delicious, and the other guest had the cippino. The service was 5 star. Kudos to the
chef and the restaurant. I will definitely return.

Went to the restaurant tonight because I had a gift certificate. Five of us dined. I ordered the Veal Milanese, which left a lot to be desired.
My broccolini could have been better. Two others at the table ordered the Bronzino, and split it.  After telling the server, a manager came over,  the Chef came out to apologize for us not liking some of our entrees and allowed us to choose other entrees.  The lamb chops, which were a replacement,  were fabulous as were the truffle fries. The other dining companion had the pork chop which she said was delicious and another had the Chilean sea bass which was fully devoured.

Suffice to say, , but KUDOS to the restaurant for doing everything right to
take care of the issue.

"I enjoyed dinner with my boyfriend at this clean and authentic establishment. However, the food itself was subpar, I fine dine frequently, most recently going to Malio‚Äôs in Tampa Florida. The escargot there was lovely as well as the one here  at la Grotta. But the burrata cheese lacked flavor, and the bread was rustic but yet again lacked flavor. The olive oil was served without any herbs or seasoning, which is fine, but it didn‚Äôt taste like a cold pressed olive oil so I was confused on why it was served so basic. Their wine list is insanely huge, and you would assume that you could find something for everyone. Unfortunately for me I like champagne, and they only have 2-3 champagne‚Äôs they sell by the glass and they are all bitter. So I had to settle with a moscato that wasn‚Äôt that good. My partner doesn‚Äôt too much care for wines, he‚Äôs more of a whiskey drinker. Although the establishment was beautiful, and the food was authentic I‚Äôm very disappointed in the initial experience me and my boyfriend had to face. Given the amount of time this establishment has been around I expected to be experiencing something better than Flemings but the food didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations.

I didn't have to wait, they were both very engaging with great personalities! I used to come 15 years ago (which was just as good), but I forgot just how excellent the food and service was. It's better than EVER!!! ( not that it wasn't before)  I'm back in the saddle again, and will be coming here at least once a week....be mindful that you may have to stand in line...but not for long. They are, from a scale from 1 to 10...a 15!!!  Sit at the bar with Nick and Holly and you'll be hooked!

"Taqueria definition: a Mexican restaurant specializing in tacos.

As a mexican, I felt out of place at this taqueria because it is NOT AUTHENTIC. This is basically a locally owned On the Border / La Frontera Grill. The food isn't the worst but far from flavorful. Even the cashier said, ""Were a boring Taqueria""

My husband hates these types of places because they profit/benefit from the name 'Taqueria' when the flavor/authenticity isn't there. It's cultural appropriation, but I'm sure it's okay since some of the workers were Hispanic, and 1 co-Founder is Mexican. But the main guy is Mike Klank, a white American. It saddens me that Mr. Hernandez has accepted to Americanize our Mexican culture for financial gain. It's altered to fit the demographic they're looking for. The same thing is happening in Mexico. I understand that, but its not right. Its white-washed.

Health inspection was an 86 B.
No onions or cilantro on the tacos.
Tacos are made with flour tortillas, not corn.
No salsa bar.
Enchilada is $4 each, and it looked like vomit. The chicken it had was rotisserie chicken.
Canned beer was $5 each.
Guac was the only decent thing there.

We took the food to go, adding a 5% fee.
We went to El Rey del Taco right after for real Mexican food.

Don't recommend and won't be back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5M2Z6ZnlBRRAB,Atlanta,en

I can eat them but with the spicy syrup and peppers, it was overwhelmingly spicy. I am just getting over an abdominal infection so the spicy flavors were just too much. I explained it to the server we had and I promise you the entire staff was involved in the request to get it switched; the whispering; the stares; the passive/aggressive behaviors were so unprofessional and petty!!!  We sat on the patio and were able to watch the entire show that was going on all initiated by our server.

The same server who denied to come outside to serve us was the one serving others when we left. I've never been treated so badly at any restaurant let alone a Planta.

I think my most fundamental critique is that as a result of the pandemic they reinvented themselves as a ‚Äúto go‚Äù restaurant and prioritize that business over in place customers.  As dine in patrons we felt somewhat neglected.  And maybe most importantly, the food deserved better.  The sushi was for the most part top notch.  The music felt as though it had been chosen to keep the sushi chef in rhythm but again, not conducive to a pleasant in place dining experience.

Atmosphere was cool,  music was cool, they couldn't change the TV channel for some reason.
Food was ok, not bad at all,  but not amazing. Drinks were weak (if you're a drinker), really sweet. Taste good,  but kool-aid, in my opinion. Probably drink 5 and just have a buzz.

I gave it a 4 because I didn't like billing.
If you have 5 or more guests, they only give 1 bill. They will only allow up to 3 cards to be charged, you would have to tell the waitress how much on each card.  We ended up just calculating our own meals and drinks, then divided the $99 gratuity equally and sent the money to 1 person to pay. I didn't like that part.

"We visited The Boiler Seafood Atlanta on a Friday around 6:30 PM. Fortunately, our server was friendly and attentive. However, we were disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered nearly all the appetizers, but none of them tasted fresh. It was as if they had been prepackaged and came straight from the freezer. For our main course, we ordered lobster bites with fried rice, two different boiler bags, and two orders of Alfredo pasta. Unfortunately, everything in the boiler bags and the fried rice was overcooked, and even the potatoes had sprouted and tasted terrible. When we complained about the taste of one of the boiler bags, they said they couldn't make another one but offered us a free cup of sauce to mask the sour taste. The two orders of Alfredo pasta looked completely different from each other. In one, the sauce was extremely thick, making it almost impossible to pull apart. In the other, the sauce was very watery and resembled soup.

Although the alcoholic drinks we ordered were tasty, they lacked alcohol. If you prefer drinks that are not overly sweet, avoid ordering them. The atmosphere was okay, but it wasn't suitable for families due to the constant hookah smoke and loud music. The parking lot is small, so valet parking is your best option.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqakliVUF3EAE,Atlanta,en

The owner‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúa postcard to (from) ??? the coast ‚Äú feels like a 1980s Balkan‚Äôs cafeteria and is dim , sterile and oddly out of place . The cocktail menu is diverse but ask for details as the descriptions really don‚Äôt give a clear picture of what you are getting and we found the flavors to be just odd in three of them .  The wine by the glass is limited and overpriced . Food is divided into ‚Äúgems‚Äù second plates and main courses .  We decided to start off with about 5 plates to share .  The scallops were horrific and sliced horizontally in a milky broth that had no flavor ; a shrimp dish with peanuts was decent but weirdly presented with the heads detached from the tails and lined up on one side of the dish ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ We had three other items that were so unmemorable I have no idea what they were . We decided to skip ordering more and bailed around the corner to the Vietnamese restaurant bar for appetizers and drinks .

"Carmel Restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance and excellent customer service, but falls short in value and freshness. While the atmosphere was inviting, the menu proved to be overpriced, and the food lacked the freshness one would expect. Despite Buckhead Shops' reputation for great dining options, and dining at Carmel in New York, this particular location left me hesitant to return. Our waitress was friendly, but lacked knowledge about the dishes and offered minimal recommendations on drinks or desserts.

"We arrived around 2:30.. didn‚Äôt put in food or drink orders until 2:50. It was maybe 10 people in the whole restaurant. So very unsure why service was awfullllllllly slow.

From there, we ordered Hanger Steak & Tenders & fries for our daughter.. we didn‚Äôt recieve that until 3:45. Again, there‚Äôs 10 people in the restaurant. Everyone just moves around like they‚Äôre on edibles. It‚Äôs so underwhelming. I‚Äôve never had to ask for a Togo box before the food came & still ended up leaving the food because it was just bad. Hanger steak was lukewarm & the tenders were fried hard & sat under the heating lamp on expo for about 10 minutes. Such a waste of money.

Instead of paying a small fortune to go to a Buckhead restaurant we get great food served with our own beverages around big table at home.

I was skeptical at first because it was so long and skinny, but it really played out well. The filling to bread ratio was spot on. Even though I've had a lot of Philly's with the traditional sub bread, this cheesesteak sub was off the charts. Let me tell you how good it is.

There were a few slivers of onions mixed in with the Steak-um meat. The fries were fresh and hot but they covered in black pepper (no salt).
I cannot speak on the pizza. But the Philly was not what I expected based on the advertisement.(Silly me) The portion was pretty small for the price $15.24.

Instead of compensating for food coming out at different times, putting sauce on chicken when asked to put it on the side, appetizer coming at the end they decided to charge us an up charge for Mac n cheese even though meal came with two sides one of which they were out of.

"This was my first time and my last time dining here. Though to say that I ""dined"" is a gross understatement. Last night, I came here with my friends who had good things to say about this restaurant. We were greeted by the owner, who bragged about servicing Stevie Wonder, the Georgia Congressional Representatives, and all the positive reviews that her establishment has received. She even went so far as to say that her Egg Fu Young was highly rated by her New York customers. As a native New Yorker I was curious about the food. We were seated and placed our orders. Well, my dish was garnished with a hair smack dab in the middle of the plate. When I brought this to our server's attention, she was very apathetic and merely took the dish back. Her response made me scared to try anything else. So while my friends apparently had no issues with their food, I just sipped on the Coke that I ordered.

When it came time to pay the bill, she handed me mine with an attitude and let me know that she removed the dish from the bill, like she was doing me a big favor. Yet, she had no problem charging me $4.36 for a so, so glass of Coke. As we were leaving, the owner stopped us and asked if everything was okay, to which I responded no. She made no effort to find out why I was unhappy with my experience. She turned her attention back to the other party that entered the restaurant and proceeded to regale them with her stories. My friend, who witnessed the exchange, was appalled by her response. Rather than cause a scene, I decided to leave. I was already disgusted by the careless lack of cleanliness. I was even more turned off by how I was treated by the staff and the owner. While I understand that things happen, how you handle the situation speaks volumes. I got the message about this place loud and clear about the value they place on offering a clean and quality dining experience. Though it has received a lot of reviews for the food, I can't confirm or deny the quality of the food, but I can tell you that the service is of very poor quality. Something to think about if you're considering dining here.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaHVYNWRBEAE,Atlanta,en

noodles( fried and soup wise),  all present which was the first time I experienced a restaurant like that that was not a buffet( I'm from the east coast). I liked it!

.we loved the lemon pepper as they were seasoned to perfection, yum! Friend said the fried rice was bland as it had little to no seasoning.

What other kind of gravy you have? She said we have other sauces. I said ma'am I didn't ask for sauce.  Sweet and sour chicken was delicious .  But I'm not paying a Surcharge for using my card.

"This hidden gem is a must try!! The staff are very friendly and will be helpful if you need assistance navigating through all of the delicious options on the menu. The food is AMAZING! Literally everything is filled with flavor. The jerk turkey wings are my favorite with the perfectly cooked and seasoned rice and peas. All of the veggies are great. Not your typical spot where the protein is usually the star of the show and the sides are mediocre. Here, you get flavor in every single dish. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the greens, cabbage, green beans, &/or broccoli. The creole spaghetti is a hit too! The manager/owner of the spot was also kind enough to let me try the rasta pasta on the house recently and it was also delicious. You really can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu here‚Ä¶. And they are consistent! Ive eaten here many times and the flavors and great portions are sheets the same.
My only knock on this place is the location (inside the Greenbriar Mall) because I know they would be even more booming in a better location! This is a spot that truly deserves community support and I hope to see them outgrow the mall.

The cabbage actually was unedible is the only flavor it had was apparently vinegar. Who plays vinegar and cabbage? As you can see by the photo there is absolutely no seasoning on it. It was just crunchy white vinegar cabbage ü§¢ The mac and cheese was just cheese noodles. No flavor whatsoever. The candy yams are actually okay But I mean, It's not hard to boil a sweet potato and add cinnamon and butter.

Of course they do though. This time, how does a cinnamon raisin bagel come not toasted but somehow hard on the outside, doughy on the inside and somehow salty. I couldn't even get past the first bite. I feel like my insides would just give up if I tried. I used to be a major supporter of Dunkin donuts but then again I've never gotten such terrible food even with delivery.

"Menu is a bit ""limited"", but I got the steak and potatoes, and it has definitely surpassed my expectations. Portions were definitely enough for me.

Steak, I'd give a solid 7.5, maybe 8/10. Good texture. Good taste. Very good. Would recommend.

Mashed Potatoes, I've had a lot of places that had very mediocre mashed potatoes where I would just leave it on my plate, but these mashed potatoes with the gravy were pretty good and I finished all of it. Perfect amount of gravy for the mashed potatoes, too. 7-7.5/10.

Carrots, I'm not a fan of carrots generally speaking. For carrots, these were good. Like 6/10 above average good. But the entire time I was eating the carrots, I just thought to myself, ""I wish these were sweet potatoes... but maybe that's just too much potato in the entree"".

Adding this place to my mental list of ""places to go to for a good steak"". I'm definitely going to have my family and friends try this place to get their opinions as well as try their other dishes.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREX0xyYWd3RRAB,Boston,en

Carrot cake was very moist and tasty. The red velvet was okay, the frosting was creamy, but the cake was lacking moistness and was a little dry. Definitely opt for the carrot cake!

"So I order using the online menu, and I‚Äôm appalled that when I picked up my order, it was $10 more than the online menu indicated.  I order 1 dinner (fried rice/2 appetizers) and small side order of Peking Ravioli (total of 4).  Cost of $24.40.  I could have splurged on Chipotle for far less and much better food.  I mentioned to the female cashier about the discrepancies of the online menu and she immediately became defensive, explaining that the online menu had been updated.  I responded that obviously some advertisers did not get the memo. She persisted to the point where I said, look, it is what it is. You haven‚Äôt informed your public and that‚Äôs on you. She blamed her boss and said she‚Äôd inform him.  I doubt I‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôd experienced surprise, and the first time she said she‚Äôd tell her boss.  I‚Äôd guess the next time she tells her boss WILL BE THE FIRST TIME though.

The food?  I‚Äô‚Äôm from Roslindale and patronized this same business since 1980 or so when it opened. Original manager was fabulous. You went in, he knew what you wanted, we talked baseball the whole time, he was a huge fan. The neighborhood owned him. He was one of us. Always the tastiest food.  Today I ordered Kung Pao extra spicy, Egg Roll, and Peking Ravioli side.  Fried rice was part of the dinner component.  I‚Äôve never tasted Kung Pao Chicken so tasteless.  Spicy?  Milk has more zest to it than this slop. And it didn‚Äôt look like a good quality dish, chicken, vegetable, etc. no peanuts which always is part of the dish. Sub par as to appetizing view. Terrible food. Egg Roll was ok. Peking‚Äôs, nothing to stop in or go out of your way for.

Being a customer of this place for over 40 years?  No more.  Done.  There are plenty of Chinese food restaurants right there in Rossie Square.  I‚Äôll give them a try.  I hope this review provides you with some forwarded insight.

"I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, it was a complete letdown. From start to finish, the service was appalling and left a sour taste in my mouth.

Upon entering, there was no warm welcome or acknowledgment from the staff. We had to wait for what felt like an eternity before anyone bothered to seat us, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.

Once seated, the wait for our orders was excruciatingly long. It took ages for a server to even come to our table to take our drink orders, and when they finally did, they seemed disinterested and unfriendly.

When the food finally arrived, it was subpar at best. The dishes were lukewarm, indicating they had been sitting out for some time before being served. Not to mention, the presentation was sloppy, and it was evident that little care went into preparing our meals.

To make matters worse, when we tried to address our concerns with the manager, they were dismissive and unapologetic. Instead of acknowledging our dissatisfaction, they brushed us off and seemed uninterested in resolving the issues.

Overall, my experience at Shaking Seafood Restaurant was incredibly disappointing. The lackluster service, mediocre food quality, and indifferent management left me feeling frustrated and unlikely to return.

I went in and the gentlemen behind the counter was so professional and kind. I‚Äôve complimented him because in my opinion it is very hard to find an all around great Haitian restaurant or Haitian food business. I came in and didn‚Äôt know what I wanted. He walked me through making up my mind. He had patience, a great tone of voice, honesty, great listening skills and such a positive energy. This is exactly what ANY restaurant should be like.

The food was amazing - GREAT PORTION  I ordered du ri jon jon ( black rice - most people call it but the correct name is dried mushroom rice ) with legumes and baked macaroni and Soup Joumou! YUMMY !!!!!! The legumes was amazing because it didn‚Äôt have too much acid in it. Some places love to add acid or too much spice to the legumes but this one was perfect! The rice was amazing also because it was fully cooked. I really don‚Äôt like ordering this kind of dish or ANY and Haitian food that is not fully cooked! I applaud this place!

I rarely write reviews but when I do it‚Äôs serious! I would like to also say I applaud the owner for believing in him and hiring him. This man will go far in life. Please continue to support employees like him. I have to also give a round of applause to the people in the back who put their work in making the food as well. I just can‚Äôt write this review and forget the employees in the back. They are part of the business as well! It‚Äôs not easy waking up everyday cooking and serving people - it can be challenging. I applaud this place. For such a small place to eat-the service and food is amazing! This goes to say never judge a book by its cover. You never know the greatness it has.

Please continue to do well in the community. I appreciate your business!

"I was told they do not use habenaro peppers, the peppers that make food hot pepper hot    . It is used to infuse flavor into Jamaican dishes but removed before it bursts into the dish. Or if it is used, they chop it and remove seeds where most of the heat lies dependent upon how ripe the pepper is. Or it can be leftbin the dish to burst for both the heat and flavor. However, not everyone can stand that Scoville scale of a hot pepper in their food. I appreciate that this establishment does not use pepper in their food.  It burns my stomach and other things. Though I was told at another restaurant, Jamaican food is ""supposed to be hot  ü•µ"", okay. But not everyone can eat peppery food.

"This is my first review for a restaurant in my life. Delivery driver Siu Yan lost his temper on me in public because my messages were full, but I have a screenshot proving I called him and that was a literal two minute difference between his first call and my being at his vehicle, I tipped almost $5 for a 0.3 mile ride. The guy hit the gas and sped off in the middle of my taking the food from him and apologizing, he yelled at me for not answering the phone?! Usually good food and service, I have been a regular for a few years now and had no issue with them at all in any way, it has always been great. I haven't had another adult give sass like a little girl before, but I'll be going elsewhere from now on.

Considering the restaurant? Go inside and see for yourself how Clean it is. I have pictures of that too since it was the topic of discussion at our family's house that we worried the place was a tad dirty, but they knew us by name and were always nice. Too bad really. I will find the photos today and post them here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0cjh1V3VBRRAB,Boston,en

This is almost 2024, I want the convenience of ordering online. If I can't do that, I am simply going to order from somewhere else from now on.

I don't understand why he couldn't have just explained to me how to order it correctly next time instead of picking a fight with me. I splurged for delivery on a Friday night and just ended up with a plate of chicken and getting yelled at on the phone.

"Recently, I ordered delivery food from Chinese Dragon. I had zero expectations (either way) for their food; it was late, but their kitchen was open and they were willing to deliver to my slightly out-of-range location for a small, additional delivery fee. (A paltry $ amount, compared to the ridiculous/endless delivery and service fees Uber Cheats, Grub Nub, etc. tack on to every order.)

45 minutes later, my food arrived -- and it was wonderful! Creamy egg drop soup; perfect saucy chicken saut√©ed to perfection with a colorful mix of tasty chinese vegetables; delicious chicken fried rice (replete with real, large chunks of meat throughout); admidst this abundance though the rich, tender beef teriaki skewers were actually the first thing to be devoured. (I would usually save one for later but hey...life is short and their siren song called me.) So good!

In summary, I still can't believe that I polished off so much food, so easily at 1am...or that there were so many (non-teriaki) leftovers the next day. A++ service and food, I highly recommend Chinese Dragon!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkeHBPZE53EAE,Boston,en

Food: The food isn‚Äôt fresh, no flavor. The fried rice was pulled from a rice pot, oily with no vegetables and heavy on the soy sauce. My entire meal was mostly rice with a few strips of spareribs. The crab ragoons were refried so the top was crispy but the bottom was soggy.

Service: Felt rushed, and oddly uncomfortable. They treated me as if I was going to steal something constantly asking me if I was ready to order. Again, first time here so I was reading the menu.

If your order is lost or damaged, the restaurant will do never about it and tells you to contact the driver or website. Doordash can't do anything either.  Skipli does not even have a way to contact them since it is a marketing site. The first time the restaurant forgot the added veggies I had paid for. Since it was 5 dollars and I just brushed it off.

We ordered Goi Ga (salad w/ chicken) as our appetizer and never got it.  We never got waters or even offered if we wanted drinks.  They didn't know what fish sauce was so definitely no Vietnamese working that evening.  After 3 tries, he did eventually figure out what we were asking for.  Our server seemed to be hiding in the kitchen most of the time.  We waited a long time after finishing our food before I had to go back there to get him to get our bill.

We waited a long time to order, our appetizer never came, the pho came out with no limes and the jalapenos were cut huge. Like one jalapeno cut into 4 large peices. Then we asked for fish sauce because the pho needed it. The staff didn't know what fish sauce is. What kind of vietnamese restaurant doesn't know what fish sauce is? Finally got some limes and fish sauce after explaining to the all non vietnamese staff what it is. Once the Pho was flavored with fish sauce and lime it was acceptable.

"BEWARE OF THE SECRET RESERVATION LIST!!

It is very well advertised that this is a ‚Äúno reservations taken‚Äù restaurant. We learned the hard way that you actually CAN make reservations (by emailing the owner directly).

So, when we put our name in for a group of 4 at 6:30 pm and the hostess told us there were only 3 tables ahead of us, we were more than happy to wait as we had been wanting to try this spot for a long time. 2 hours after patiently waiting outdoors (you can‚Äôt wait indoors here), and after watching many groups stroll in to their RESERVED tables, we decided to check in with the hostess. Her advice was that we should have made a reservation by contacting the owner directly.

So, if you find yourself waiting for a table here, just know that the empty table you see through the window may just remain empty until a limo full of people with a secret reservation arrives for their 8:15 reservation.

Easy fix: instead of leading on to your customers that they are the third ones in line for a table, tell them the truth (we have some large parties tonight, special event or request, etc).

UPDATE:
Although still confused and disappointed that I could not get a phone answered before heading to Luna's - once we arrived we were treated very well. Every accommodation was made to service us to our liking. The foods were varied, fresh and delicious!! You could tell the chef and staff take great care and pride. The place is IMMACULATE!! A must for me when dining out. I loved the Latin cuisine infusion to traditional dishes. The servings were ample enough by my measure [I'm not a glutton and understand portion control] and aside from being delicious everything was fresh and prepared to order. Unlike many who commented here, we did not find rude, neglectful staff on hand; nor did we find the prices outrageous for these ""Biden's - Build Back Better"" out of control inflationary times. If they put on a general recording on the phone to answer FAQ, this would be a huge help. But answering the phone is even better!! We merely needed to know if they in fact were OPEN and hadn't succumbed to a Biden Administration induced demise. We were happy to learn they hadn't!!

Came for the seafood but stayed for the cocktails and chill vibes. We sat at bar so did not get a chance to get familiar with menu or hear about dishes. The oysters were great! Did not like raw clams (too fishy for my taste). Cocktails were suburb. They had a lobster and waffle dish which was so unique and good! Lobster was a bit overcooked but the flavor they had def made up for probably a rare mistake (the lobster in lobster roll was not overcooked and melted in mouth). Brussel sprouts were also phenom and could be a meal in itself.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaHY2LUtnEAE,Boston,en

"I post a review on Google only for something exceptionally good or exceptionally bad; unfortunately, Saltie Girl was the latter.

I wanted a quick clam chowder lunch before heading home, and Saltie Girl had been mentioned more than once as making a good one. What a disappointment! It was over-thickened, over-salted, under-clammed, and for some odd reason served topped by two fried clams with breading that had already turned soggy.

And speaking of soggy, the French fries were limp as can be. They were listed on the menu as having black garlic and truffle, but truffle flavor (truffle salt?) was all I could taste. I did see some black specs, which I hoped and assumed were some sort of edible item, but otherwise the garlic was absent.

The host was courteous and helpful (this was the only reason I gave two stars instead of one), but the server committed a major faux pas for a higher-end restaurant by not asking, after I ate only half of the chowder and maybe a quarter of the fries, if I was unhappy with the food.

I also ordered a shiso cocktail, which tasted mostly of citrus and sugar, a little bit of gin, and not at all of shiso except for one tired leaf affixed to the glass by an adorable little clothespin.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa3RPdHJ3RRAB,Boston,en

This restaurant has PLENTY of wait staff, they are all just condescending, rude, and make you wait on yourself. Service on a Saturday at 3pm was abysmal despite a plethora of servers. We were made to feel like a burden for simply existing in the restaurant even though we were nothing but polite and undemanding.

My husband is a black man who was wearing jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt.  We order pickup through Grubhub a lot as we don't dine-in due to my husband's health issues. This woman made a judgment upon sight and tried to refuse someone a meal they paid for.

"My friend and I went in on a Sunday for a quick, last minute brunch at 3pm. Hosts were great. Food was good. Our server, Valerie F., was not. Maybe she was ready to clock out, bad day, upset she was working on a Sunday... i'm not sure.

Valerie F. had the worst attitude taking our drink order, she was very impatient when taking our food order, she dropped the food off, and was never seen again. My friend went to the kitchen area to ask for a box and as he was walking back to the table, he overheard Valerie say, ""oh, he can come back here to get a box but not his check."" (Rude and uncalled for - considering she had not been back to our table to check on us at all). He turned right around, went back to Valerie , and asked for our check. For context, the restaurant closes at 4pm on Sundays. We paid (with the hostess by the way because Valerie did not come get our debit card) and were out of the doors at 4:05pm.

This was our first time visiting Dame's Chicken and Waffles in Cary and was extremely disappointed in the service and behavior of Valerie. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this location and spending time and money in an establishment that condones this kind of behavior.

Dames Chicken and Waffles corporate office, restaurant management, and/or God himself should have a conversation with Valerie and I pray she has the day she deserves.

"A Friendly Visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles

I had been eagerly anticipating my first visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles, so I arrived bright and early on a Sunday morning at 9:45 am, only to realize that they don't open until 10 am ‚Äì my bad for not double-checking the hours beforehand! But arriving early turned out to be a blessing, as a small line had already formed outside, and more folks were joining in anticipation of a delicious breakfast.

Once seated, I ordered a glass of water, coffee, and orange juice. However, my excitement dipped momentarily when I noticed some food crumbs in my water. Nonetheless, I decided to give the menu a good look, settling on a waffle with maple pecan-infused butter and the American breakfast.

The waffle, accompanied by its unique buttery topping, was decent, but not quite the flavor explosion I had hoped for. The American breakfast, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark either ‚Äì the turkey bacon was a tad bland, and the sausage patties seemed a bit overdone. But hey, the buttery grits were surprisingly tasty!

To my disappointment, the coffee arrived on the colder side and lacked the robust flavor I was expecting. Despite these minor setbacks, when the bill arrived, I couldn't help but feel it was a tad steep for the overall dining experience.

In the end, while my visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles didn't entirely live up to my expectations, I left with a hopeful outlook. I'm confident that with a bit of attention to cleanliness and perhaps some tweaks to the menu, this charming spot has the potential to provide an even more delightful dining experience for its future guests.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHJPSTh3RRAB,Cary,en

"Home of the no syrup is needed! Yall we had never been to Dames but have heard about it. Like chicken and waffles is chicken and waffles right‚Ä¶wrong! These dang waffles were so good that we never even touched the syrup!

Like we spread some of the flavored butter (peach and something for me, my lil cousin had maple pecan), took a bite and that was all she wrote.

That was THE BEST WAFFLE EVER! Like it was soft and flavorful (by the way it was the original). And can‚Äôt forget them chicken wings. They were nice and hot and crispy and that little sauce was oh so good. Go try them out if you haven‚Äôt because we were pleasantly surprised and will be hitting up the Greensboro spot soon!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNELTdEX2l3RRAB,Cary,en

Sports bars that make you feel like it‚Äôs home have disappeared, except for this gem :) Located in an easy location coming from RTP, airport, and Raleigh, it‚Äôs a great spot for some food and drink. They have a larger Tesla charging area in this parking lot. It‚Äôs one exit to the airport when you don‚Äôt want to hang out in the airport too long. It‚Äôs one exit from PNC Arena so a great spot to stop pre and post any show.
There is a large patio with a projector for only the best games. Large yard games for everyone to enjoy. TV‚Äôs everywhere so you never miss a game or Chive TV lol. The beer selection has yet to disappoint as they cater to everyone. The food is fresh, supports local bakeries and has some of the best comfort food! Fish & Chips, burgers, wings and some delicious dishes on the menu. One of my favorite Cheesesteaks around.

"I've frequented New China several times, but my experiences have often been marred by unpleasant interactions with some of the female staff members. Their demeanor often comes across as rude, which has been consistently off-putting.

Moreover, their ordering system, where they require a complete order before handing over the food, seems inefficient and unnecessary. This process would make more sense if there was an option to pre-pay to ensure the order matches the right customer. However, as it stands, it feels like an extra, pointless step that adds to the overall frustration.

I've also noticed a concerning pattern that suggests possible racial bias in the way customers are treated. This has been a recurring issue in my visits, leading me to question the inclusivity and customer service approach of the restaurant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMUpTY1FnEAE,Cary,en

I understand that it's a 'drive thru' but communication would've been sufficent, even if it was a "" sorry m'am, cars only"" INSTEAD I was mocked and humilated! The staff laughed hysterically as they served the car ahead of me, joking with the current customer and looking back at me shaking their head because they have never seen a mom who was willing to do whatever was needed to feed her children. I didn't served, but I did get embarressed!

"If I could give this Burger King 0 stars I would. Just moving here from Charlotte, NC, it‚Äôs late at night and my boyfriend and I wanted a quick bite without cooking. On our way home we decided to stop at the Burger King conveniently located near our apartment and order through the mobile app. We double checked the hours to make sure they were still open and placed our order at 9:58 pm. Keep in mind that when you place an order through the app, it‚Äôs already paid. We get to the drive thru and they won‚Äôt respond to us, even after saying hello several times. After driving around the store twice and going up to the window, we beeped the car horn and someone finally arrived, staring at us without saying anything. We told the lady that we placed a mobile order on the app and she said we‚Äôre closed. We responded letting her know their hours are until 11 pm and we‚Äôve already paid on the app. She then responds that she can‚Äôt do anything about that. So we‚Äôre out money and drove away hungry.

"WOW. Just wow. I should start by saying I am very picky. I am a chicken tender and california roll kind of girl. The courses I chose were the crab, scallop, duck, and chocolate. The crab was EXQUISITE. Who knew sea urchin custard would actually be good? The scallop was cooked to perfection, the duck was the perfect cut, and the passionfruit and chocolate combo was to die for. The small bites in between were amazing too- wonderful breads and the best corn dogs you could ask for! The service was amazing as well. Our fabulous server Casey explained everything in great detail and made sure we were well taken care of. The presentation of food and drink as well as the clearing of plates were so smooth and clearly well practiced. Each staff member I interacted with was full of knowledge and so amazing helping! Megan made the best hot chocolates, Carlos followed up with perfectly foamed and decorated lattes. Kacy, Rachel, Lizzie, Mari, Josie, Mike, and Tim were fantastic about clearing exactly on time and so incredibly kind in my brief interactions with them. Kalyn was a fantastic hostess and so incredibly accommodating. Another fantastic part of the evening was meeting the wonderful Chef Spencer! He and all of the other kitchen staff put SO much care and effort into making our dishes wonderful. The atmosphere was very cozy with lovely music playing just quiet enough for conversation but just loud enough to set an uplifting mood. I‚Äôm sure there are many other names I forgot to get, but truly the experience was wonderful and one I will never forget. Thank you to the amazing Heron‚Äôs staff for making my birthday so special!

The place was beautifully decorated but not the least bit overbearing. And the atmosphere was quiet yet celebratory throughout the restaurant. Clearly everyone there was happy.

And for the food.... I can't begin to describe the complexity of flavors. Every course was unique and delightful. We chose the wine pairing option; it was every bit as delicious and harmonious as the food creations. The Sommelier knew his trade, providing outstanding selections that complimented every course.

"Each time we've been to Ruth's Chris it was been a fabulous experience. The service is amazing. Friendly, prompt and knowledgeable, not to mention the food comes out very quick. The atmosphere is always calm, quiet and intimate. The food is outstanding- not a single complaint. We've had the porterhouse for two, ribeyes, garlic mash, creamed spinach, lyonnaise, osso bucco ravioli and banana foster. Everything was amazing and piping hot. I would definitely recommend Ruth's Chris if it's within your budget.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbnNUN0Z3EAE,Cary,en
"We have been long time customers of this location. We even hold our annual company Christmas parties at Ruth's. However, last night we wanted to have a nice meal, but had a time limitation, due to friend leaving on a flight. We decided to get our meal ""to go"" so that we had some schedule control. We ordered on 4-11-24 at 4:30 pm online with a 6:30 pick up. When we arrived no one new anything about our order. The server at the bar was extremely friendly, apologetic and was helpful, but returned without the order. We showed the receipt and she agreed that all was in order. The server said they would get ""right on it"" and  would have our order soon. At nearly 7, she brought out the order.
On the way out, we asked to speak to the manager. Surprisingly, he was aware of the situation, but did not seek us out. Whether intentional or not, he came across as aloof and unconcerned. He said that there was little he could do since we had paid for the meal online. He said that they didn't know their ""tablet"" wasn't working and they didn't receive the order, so.......

In an upscale dining establishment like Ruth's and particularly since we have been long time customers, we would anticipate a better experience. Frankly, we would have rated the service 0-1 if not for the server that helped us at the bar.

Sadly, based on this experience, we will take our business elsewhere.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMWNUTTRRRRAB,Cary,en

"The quality of food at Ruth Chris has gone down. My ribeye  had no flavor. The only part that was good was the fat. I have eaten at Ruth Chris a few times and this was my husband first time. He said we won't be going back. His red snapper looked like a baby tilapia and he said it was distasteful along with the bed of rice. We did like our calamari appetizer and the creamed spinach was good. Also, my wine was good (Vietti). If we try Ruth Chris again it will be in North Hills. This one was a huge disappointment when I was craving a flavorful steak.

Our server was good and attentive. There were two managers that walked around checking on guests and seemed engaged, however, one of them was selective in who he approached. We were in a more private area and he consistently went to the other two tables but didn't ever come to my husband and I table. He should be careful with behavior like that. It could be perceived negatively.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNDRXQUx3EAE,Cary,en
"I‚Äôm not even a picky eater (and I was very hungry) so I‚Äôd have eaten even a mediocre meal and enjoyed it at that point - but I still had to send back a few items.

The calamari tasted like soggy batter, probably the worst calamari I‚Äôve had.

My steak had far too much butter. It was drowning in it to where the steak tasted awful.

When I mentioned to the manger they just argued with me and then picked it up and walked off.

I didn‚Äôt know if they were making a new one, or refunding me and not bringing a new one, or what - until server explained what the plan was.

I don‚Äôt want to only point out negatives always try to be balanced - our server was nice and honest, the wine was quite good, and so was the desert.

That said, for what it costs they really do need to work on how they prepare some dishes to be more consistent- and they need a manager who can communicate effectively or arms who actually cares about having standards.

As many have noted in the last 9-12 months of reviews the place has gone downhill.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkN3B6LUd3EAE,Cary,en

First I want to commend the front of house staff and everyone that had a hand in the brunch event today it was great food and wonderful people. The reason for the one star review is the owner or manager Brian. What an absolute horrible experience. From cutting off your own staff while we are in the middle of being seated. Talking down to them. Not listening to a word we said about being for the event. Sitting us in the wrong section and not letting anyone know we were there at all. When we finally got up and asked about maybe getting some water after 20 minutes he informed us that there was a process to the event and we needed to be patient. Meanwhile in the room the event was going on they were already on their second drinks and appetizers. The entire time he spoke down to us like we were an inconvenience to be at his restaurant. Watching him interact with other guest and his staff I couldn‚Äôt believe how he was. Simply put everything and everyone except this person was outstanding and we would love to come back once he‚Äôs no longer there. Hope others see the great staff and food and don‚Äôt take it out on them. Brian is the issue.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURELTZXcG1RRRAB,Cary,en
Went in for lunch today. The waiter we had was great however it took forever to get out food. The waiter ended up comping our drinks due to the long wait for food. I‚Äôm talking over 40mins for a Caesar salad and steak with shrimp. I could understand a longer wait time if the place was busy or even half full but there was very few patrons.  My wife ordered the filet medium however when it was brought to the table it was cooked well past well done. You could tell whoever made it was not very experienced in cooking steaks . I will say the appetizers and drinks we had were good however  we will not be back to this location.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaDlfUDVnRRAB,Cary,en
"My grandparents made a reservation for brunch on 4/14. We were greeted by a sweet hostess but then was soon bombarded by another employee, who we soon found out was one of the managers, Brian. Pushy, unprofessional, insulting manager. Was talking down to his staff as if they‚Äôre all idiots.
I could go in detail about what else he did during the entire time we were there (because there was a lot) but what really set me off is when he gave my grandparents and my fianc√© and I check, while trying to walk away, he told us to basically learn how to make a reservation better next time. My fianc√© stopped him from leaving and asked him to repeat himself and the manager stated because my sweet grandfather called to make our reservation and did not use their website, that‚Äôs why they weren‚Äôt aware we were there for the brunch event. (Event though we stated that we were when we checked in)

We will not be going back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaDdpMk5nEAE,Cary,en

"I'm usually a big fan and a regular at your spot in Cary, but I've got to be honest about my latest experience - it was a bit of a letdown. Ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery, and one of them came with a sweet ""with love"" sticker on the box. Nice touch, right? Well, it was until I found myself fishing out hairs from my pizza. Yep, more than one. It turned my stomach, and not in a good way.

I even made the trip back to your store to return the hairy surprise because, well, it was that off-putting. I mean, the sticker said ""with love"", but it felt more like ""with extra toppings I didn't ask for"".",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEZ2VxYVd3EAE,Cary,en

I enjoyed the red beans ü´ò and rice , the corn  bread , the gumbo, the jambalaya,  and the fried alligator  bites. These were all flavored nicely and seasoned well. I would definitely order this again.

I ordered the bourbon Brownie. I didn't like this one. The bourbon sauce was just like eating sugar. The Brownie had a lot of sugar throughout it. The ice cream  was hood though.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMWZDSmJBEAE,Cary,en
"We were looking for something different, and we're thinking oysters. We decided to check the big easy oven and tap as their website looked amazing. We live 45 minutes to an hour away but we're going to be in the area so we decided to try it. We pulled up and it looked like the place was empty, but there was actually a few people at the bar. We ordered drinks and fried calamari to start and the drinks were good, the calamari was decent, but overdone and a little chewy. My wife got the catfish po' boy and she really liked it. Fries were very good as well. I got the taste of New Orleans and for $17 I felt very jipped. They give you three little cups of rice with a little of each offering on top. Rice and beans, gumbo and jambalaya. Three tiny fried shrimp on the side. Outside of the shrimp, the three cups of the other things were just warm. One almost cold. Needless to say we were not impressed. The atmosphere is dated and the bathrooms are absolutely horrible! This place is a candidate for a bar rescue from John Tapper! It has potential but falls way short of what they show on their website",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcHVIMU13EAE,Cary,en

We had to seat ourselves when we walked in and it almost empty in the restaurant. Drink tasted very watered down. The appetizers were good and the nachos saved the entire experience. Shrimp and grits was served cold and had to be remade. I really didn't like the presentation of the Shrimp and grits which had cold cheese thrown on top.

"We had an outside table. I went here yesterday because I wanted to spoil myself for working hard the past week. I certainly went to the wrong place. I ordered bourbon chicken and orange alcohol drink. Also, i ordered crab cakes as an appetizer. They were horrible. It was falling apart, very soggy. But I didn't even complain about that. My husband tried, and copied my drink ordered. When they brought the drinks to the table my husband didn't like the drink it tasted sour and bitter. Mine was nice and sweet. He told the waitress and she asked the manager if they could switch out for something more pleasant. And they denied it and said we would have to pay for both. They are not in the business of giving out free drinks. Which was fine, we don't expect them to accommodate their everyone. Then we ordered dessert. We ordered beignets, and they gave them to us raw. The middle was creamy, I'm kicking myself because I should have taken a picture. The waitress said she was sorry and they just hired a new cook. Poor excuse to a paying customer. I don't want to say it was a racial thing. But the manager should at least come to the table and smooth things over.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5b2N6TDdnRRAB,Cary,en

Got my order and the drink size was wrong, the guy was nice and was making it right.  When I went to get my drink it was a girl handing me the drink, I am in a very low sports car and it was 9pm, she was handing it to me carefully which I thought was odd but when I went to place it in my cup holder realized there was no lid as it spilled all over me and my dash board.  When I turned around the guy was back in the window horrified handing me napkins and the lid saying he was sorry!  The girl was walking off...the guy said something to her and when she spoke I recognized her voice as the one taking my order.  Called and chatted with a shift manager that was nice and was wanting me to speak to the manager cause he stated this has happened before.  Manager has yet to call back and it has been a week.

I didn‚Äôt think to specify because the last time I was made to feel stupid for specifying the type of noodles. So I called to let him know and all he could say was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell you‚Äù. To add insult to injury this is by far the most disgusting dish I have ever tasted. It tastes like slop.

From the moment I opened my shrimp lo mien and sesame chicken, I was impressed by the inviting aromas that wafted from each dish.
The menu offered an extensive selection of classic Chinese dishes, ranging from General Tso's chicken to vegetable lo mein. Each item I ordered was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The attention to detail in preparation was evident, with ingredients and a balance of flavors that made every bite a delightful experience.
The efficiency of the take-out service was commendable. My order was ready for pickup within the promised time, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.
Portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I had enough for a satisfying meal and leftovers for the next day. This value for money made the experience even more enjoyable.

"My boyfriend and I dined here a few weeks ago for a date night and we were very impressed. We were both craving Eastern European food and Sophie's exceeded our expectations. The owner is from Bulgaria and has a lot of unique food and drinks on her menu.

We were able to make reservations and we asked for a booth. There are lots of fresh flowers and plants decorating this restaurant. We loved the vibes and definitely felt like we were transported to a restaurant in Europe. I started with a bourbon drink called the Boulevardier with Campari and it was delicious. My boyfriend had a bourbon. We ordered the Armenian figs appetizer, and my only complaint is the bacon was barely cooked. That is on me though because I should have specified we like our bacon well done.

For our entrees my boyfriend had the Balkan's wine kebab and I had the stuffed cabbage rolls. My entree was really good, but next time I'm ordering the wine kebab. The flavors were amazing!

"I've been coming to this place now and then since they opened this restaurant because it's close to my house. This is not the one of best szechuan restaurants although I have not found one in NC yet like ones in CA or NY. However, better than or similar to szechuan garden or chengdu 7 in my opinion.

I only had limited number of dishes so far, but here are what I recommend and not recommend:

Not recommend
- General Tso's chicken, it is not typical general tso dish. They use ketchup or tomato based sauce and not spicy at all. Also wish they cut the meat into smaller pieces.

- Kungpao chicken, same reason above

- Beef string bean with garlic sauce, expected clean garlic based sauce, but it had the same flavor of General Tso. Disappointed.

- Lo Mein or Chow Fun, any noodle based dish, they way overcook noodles, so noodles become too mushy and stuck together (see photo)

- Any fried rice, just not good.

- Mushu (Pork) - Super sweet and very little meat, mostly cabbage, wish they use shredded fresh cooked pork, not precooked dry bbq pork (see photo)

Recommend
- Chongqing diced chicken, not the best I've had but pretty good, it is fried (see photo)

- Salt and pepper spare rib, good but it is also fried (see photo)

I will say that some of the tables were not clean when I looked for a place to sit. It wasn't a big deal because there were some clean tables available. I also couldn't find napkins. In other stores there is a place where there are napkins, straws and condiments. I looked around but could not find it here.

"We have eaten here many times since it opened. We had guests in from out of town and it was a perfect place to meet. Mason our server was the only good thing about the night. Our Caesar salad had absolutely no taste at all. Followed by a chicken parm that was pounded so thin and fried we had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. At $26for chicken parm I do not think it was even an entire chicken breast. There was nothing moist or juicy in this entree at all. Also ordered was a maybe 2 inch by 3 inch piece of eggplant parm for $24. The veggies it came with were good. Clearly the portions have gone down and the prices have gone up. Our guests did not finish their food and I believe were just being polite in not saying it was not good. To top it off on the bill they added a non cash adjustment for using a credit card!! All I can say is with all the Italian restaurants in the area that are far superior, more affordable and better quality we will never return!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEaHNUM2hRRRAB,Cary,en
"Had such a pleasant experience, the Cesar salad was amazing,  so was the fresh bread. The chef Tagliolini was so good too, got it with shrimp and extra sauce.

Honestly I don't even know where to start. There aren't enough wonderful words to describe this authentic Italian restaurant. My husband and I love traveling and trying different cuisines and restaurants. I have to say in all my life I have never been to a place where I was more impressed with the staff than anything else. Don't get me wrong the food was AMAZING but the staff were so warm and welcoming. We truly felt like we were part of the family. I seriously thought they seated us and mistook us for a different family with a reservation because of how accommodating and attentive they were. We live 4 hours away but will absolutely be returning every time we are in the area! I've already told others about this wonderful place and they are looking forward to going. The smile on my son's face shows just how happy we all were. Thank you for such a perfect experience!,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5eGZiZVpREAE,Cary,en
"Food is good, but short of amazing. The wait staff is really good, but there's bus staff and hosts that need to be trained a lot better, because they take away from the experience.

My family and I made a reservation for 6 people. One of our guest couldn't make it. When they sat us down the waitress said where is your 6th person. I told her they can no longer make it. She went and got the host to make us move to a smaller table because we were no longer 6 guests we were only 5 guests. Minutes later they sat a family of 5 in that same spot they made us move. I was furious! I felt discriminated and shamed. The food was also very expensive and it really wasn't that good. I'll never be back there again. They don't welcome Hispanics and the food is mediocre,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5djVmdmhRRRAB,Cary,en

"I‚Äôve eaten here before, but it‚Äôs been awhile. I guess people are cutting corners with the price of food. The shrimp tempura did not have tempura batter. It was heavy like a fishstick. I had the chicken tempura roll and shrimp tempura roll. Mostly all batter. Added more veggies to make it look big. I‚Äôm not certain the chicken was real chicken. Looked pressed. Even their white sauce was no longer tasty. I was disappointed because I use to really enjoy their food. Waste of money and time. Will not return.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5ellEQ253RRAB,Cary,en

"Tried this place because of the good reviews. LIES!!! Ordered General Tso's chicken and requested it to be extra extra spicy. Food was barely warm, had ZERO spice and pretty much no flavor except for being overly sweet. The ""meat"" was mostly batter, chewy and tasted of old oil. Did they try to re-fry old chicken or was their oil just overdue for a change? I don't know, but the food was not good at all. I had to toss it. Pork eggroll was a little more edible, but soft and on the chewy side.  It did not smell of old oil like the General Tso's, but maybe the eggroll was old too? The girl at the counter was nice enough, but based on  this food experience, I will never go back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeTdHYVNBEAE,Cary,en

I‚Äôve been a RUCKUS fan ever since. Their Pain Killers are magical and their food is always consistent. When the owner is in, he checks with every  customer to make sure the experience met expectations. During my dining experience last night, my server, Ryan ( Cary) greeted me with a jovial spirit and continued to update me about when my Ultimate Pizza would be ready.

"Take some pride. Terrible leadership. $140 order for take out and once I arrive (after the recommended 25min wait time) we got to wait another 40min for our food. That led to a cold pizza that we sent back which then led to cold food. The host group up front was doing their best as they tried to handle a ton of people and demands and had an average age of 14 ha! So I don‚Äôt blame them. But the owner standing in the back, on his phone several times, walking around like everything was fine was clearly the issue.
Your people are drowning. Now is not the time to act like everything is okay. Jump in and be a soldier. Rescue the drowning and take some pride in your establishment. Your employees are looking to you for guidance and help‚Ä¶ unfortunately you were no where around them.
Been here several times. The food isn‚Äôt bad and the vibe is fine. But I can‚Äôt watch these poor kids treading water while you think everything is good.
Won‚Äôt be back but I doubt that matters. If it did, you would have been at the front with the other 15 or so people who were frustrated at their order, wait time, service, and experience.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENVBYMnlBRRAB,Cary,en

Chilli was cold. Glad I could take it home to eat later. I love the food here and normally have great things to say.  But tonight was a much different story.

"Our first time here left a fairly good impression. The food was decent, service was excellent (we were seated on a low top, which was important to us, and he came by to get us new drinks every now and then). We both got turkey pesto sandwiches, which were light on the stomach. The side of carrots wasn‚Äôt that good, but the flavors grew on me as I ate more. What we got left us feeling full but not gross. Jalape√±o poppers were good but there were too few for the price. Definitely will come back, an overall positive experience!

We did come back and I tried the country fried chicken salad. The chicken was a little over-fried (extra crispy), and the salad itself was good. Pretty hearty mix of veggies. The crispy fried shrimp are small but mighty. That dipping sauce packs a lotta flavor. The fried shrimp is probs what we‚Äôre gonna get every time from now on.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5ckpUUTVRRRAB,Cary,en

"This was a favorite of ours. This was top place we would bring visitors. As you see my previous review. Today we decided to try breakfast. The service was awful. The food was disgusting. I have had better waffle at hotel  continental breakfast than this. The potatoe wedges were nothing but grease. This was one of my worst experiences at reasturant. The waiter showed no care about our meal. I will not say what I saw in the bathroom. That was absolutely disgusting. It truly was sad how they showed no care in our experience.  If they showed care about it. We would chalk up as off day. It could been handled so differently. I have spent well Over 24 years in customer service. Then to boot we got home and realized there was 9.90 tip when we said no tip on the screen. We were told it was our mistake. To end it If you try it best of luck. I will NEVER visit this reasturant again.  This is absolutely awful service.  Truly disappointed how everything was handled.

This was our second time here. The food is great. It is fresh and quality and most everything is house made. The pretzel is must try. The atmosphere is great and the outdoor seating is great.

I recently moved and there are probably 10 other Chinese restaurants very close by, but I drive the extra distance for Orient Garden. The sesame chicken is my favorite. It is crispy, the chicken is good quality, and you can actually taste the sesame flavor. The fried rice is always very fluffy and fresh.
My only suggestion would be to add sides of the veggies. Such as a half size of the vegetarian delight or broccoli in brown sauce. A full sized entree is usually too much for me, as I‚Äôm usually just ordering for myself, and I enjoy a little veg on the side.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxbGVQS1ZBEAE,Cary,en

"For the longest time I thought their food was good, but overpriced. I never really went often due to the closest location being about 25 minutes from me. However, with fast food costing what it does today, this is a much better value. It's about $12 for their half pound steak burger combo when you add cheese. That's pretty much what you're going to pay for a similar sized meal at a fast food place. I'd rather come here every time given the choice. Service was excellent the last time I was at this location, with the guy at the register being so friendly and helpful with refills, extra ketchup, and asking how my day was going. Tons of toppings to choose for free, but I wish they'd use whole leaf lettuce instead of chopped pieces. Minor complaint. The fries and simple but fresh, crispy, and well salted. My family left full and happy. A great alternative to fast food and way more economical than Five Guys.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkaUktVThRRRAB,Cary,en

"My husband and I came to North Carolina from Pennsylvania for a friend's wedding. Our hotel was near and my husband decided to surprise me with lunch. I had no idea where we were going, we just knew we were starving. To my absolute delight he brings me here to La Cocina!!! This establishment has such a cozy, relaxed atmosphere and I loved that they were playing good old fashioned Spanish music that I was super familiar with and was able to sing along with and dance in my seat to, as I enjoyed my meal. There was a very small ""lunch crowd"" I guess you could call it but, not rowdy or anything of the sort thankfully. Now to the SERVICE! Our server was Alex (Alejandro actually but I guess he uses Alex for the job). This gentleman is an absolute GEM!!! From the moment he introduced himself and took our drink orders, his demeanor was wonderful. He gave awesome, detailed recommendations about the variety of sangria's and drinks that they served. I went with his recommendations! lol When he brought us our drinks, he asked if we were ready to order and I proceeded to ask him about the menu since it was my first time ever visiting. He was so detailed and took his time explaining as well as recommending a variety of items to try. My husband ordered the Tender Ribeye and I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas. They served you tortilla chips and homemade salsa as you wait for your food. Without a doubt, their house salsa is one of, if not THE best salsa both my husband and I have ever had! We told Alex how much we enjoyed it and I didn't realize it at the time but, he took note of it! (keep this in mind for later). Now, my mother back in Pa has been looking for a place that makes authentic tamales and unfortunately, we can't find anywhere back home in PA. As luck would have it, what happened to be on the menu???? You guessed it...TAMALES! lol So I told Alex about my mom's predicament with her sooooo desired tamales and told him that I would like to try one to see if I liked it, so as to bring some back to my mom. He jotted down an order for 1 along with the rest of our food and went away to the kitchen. When he comes back, this wonderful gentleman came back with not 1 but 2 tamales, each made differently, so that I may try them and decide which one to take back home. He was super attentive, truly cared about whether or not we were enjoying the food and that we had everything that we needed as well as talking with us as if we were old friends catching up after a long time. All that along with never missing a beat with his other tables! Needless to say my husband and I enjoyed our experience here in every aspect. I ended up ordering a dozen tamales to take back home lol. I thanked Alex for absolutely everything and especially for making my first ever Mexican restaurant experience in North Carolina such a wonderful one. OH, and we also took a huge container of that delicious salsa of theirs back home too! LOL! If you want a great dining experience that will make your taste buds dance, and an even more awesome dining experience because of such amazing quality servers, then definitely come here to La Cocina! My husband and I cannot wait to come back on vacation next year and eat here again!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMXRYeGRnEAE,Cary,en

It left me in a shock and i snubbed him.

What kind of lunatic hires this subway is making here? Why are you hiring psychos? If this guy is saying that we dont condone violence over here, Is this something that the owner has given guidelines or turned a blind eye to? This was the weirdest experience that I have ever had. You come to eat a meal and some purposeless rando asks you to fight with them.

To this kid, give yourself 10 years, when your male hormones will subside, I would love to check with you if you still want to fight with random strangers and go bankrupt paying settlements.

Btw if the owner doesnt apologize for this, I am going to send the email up the subway mgmt chain. Lets see now how much would this rando cashier would like to box with future customers. This is a lawsuit in making.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaN1BTeHlnRRAB,Cary,en

The next delightful/delicious moment was the joy of eating my delicious pizza and salad. The pizza always has generous toppings and I love the crust. It's perfection!

"I have been to this Chick-fil-A four or five times since it opened about four months ago, and the experience has improved each time! They have a mostly brand new staff that is still learning, but the extremely negative tone of the reviews shared here does not match the quality of experiences I‚Äôve had - The food was delicious, the staff was professional and attentive, the service was excellent and the store was clean!

As a former employee, I know Chick-fil-A has set the customer service bar high for its customers, and with this being a new location they certainly have room to grow in speed, accuracy and efficiency. However, to go a step further and demonize the community surrounding the store (as many reviews have done) is too far.

As you all know, Chick-fil-A traditionally operates stores in more affluent/middle class communities, and this particular store is located right on the boundary line between a high poverty neighborhood and a very affluent neighborhood in Charlotte. I can‚Äôt help but think this unique reality unfairly contributes to people‚Äôs perception of the store and its employees if the quality of service isn‚Äôt at the high standard they expect it to be.

In addition to providing great food and good service to customers, this store also provides over a hundred people with stable, high quality employment within walking distance of their homes. I‚Äôm not sure how many employees live in the community surrounding the store, but having employment options walkable to lower income residents is super rare in car-dependent cities like Charlotte, and it‚Äôs worth being excited about!

So don‚Äôt let these reviews keep you from giving this location a shot. Cut them some slack and give them some time to train their employees and develop them. And if the drive through line is long, park and walk in - 9 out of 10 times it‚Äôs faster anyway.

Thanks for reading - I‚Äôll certainly be back!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdWRMRml3RRAB,Charlotte,en

I placed and paid for my order then when I pulled up to the window I was informed that they didn‚Äôt have the kale crunch salad and they asked that I pick something else because it would be easier than to do a refund.

My first visit when I got a second bowl, I had accidentally thrown my spoon away so I asked for another one.  The older lady with the black hair in a ponytail with bangs pointed to the eating area.  I went to get a spoon.  However, the spoons were stationed on top of the trash.  I went back to the counter and asked for a spoon.  She aggressively pointed to the dining area.  I told her that I don't want a spoon from the trash area.  She reluctantly gave me one from behind the counter.

The second visit was similar.  This time, I ordered.  She gave me a pen and receipt to sign for the purchase after, I used my credit card.  When I had finished signing, she abruptly (snatched) the receipt from my hand.  Needless to say...this is my last visit here.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNDdLalZnEAE,Charlotte,en

I've been ordering the Chicken, Shrimp and Broccoli (spicy) for 20 years, but tonight's version was bland and disappointing. The sauce has changed. The eggdrop was bland as well. I ordered $200 of food tonight for my family, who have also eaten at Taipei Express for 20+ years and they noticed the drop in quality as well. What happened to the recipes?? This is NOT the same food. To boot they don't serve the homemade fried wanton strips anymore!

I get to save my people-ing energy for the pick up window, and they are always nice, probably because they haven't had to go back and forth with me for my order! Everything is relaxed and easy.

There is something here for introverts and extroverts. Extroverts get to people at the pick up window, and introverts don't have to go through the horror of communicating their order to an actual person.

Came to eat here After sending some stuff in the mail for my job

Until I saw my bill after I paid and she charged me for the spicy tuna, she got me a new one, but I had to wait until my bowl came out to eat.

"Atmosphere: 5
Food: 4
Service: 2.5

I was looking for a place to take my boyfriend for a celebration dinner, and this place had such a cool vibe on the pictures online and we love Asian food. The location is at a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking, and I promise the inside looks nicer than the outside. The inside is cool and modern, and the pictures of the lady on the wall look like my mom when she younger lol.

We came on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating indoor, and at the bar, but we opted for outdoor seating since it was so nice out. I also saw a sign for a great happy hour deal, so I'll have to come back one day.

Let's start with the food. We ordered the Golden roll, and the pork belly buns, and both were delicious! For my entree, I had a Thai noodle dish that was extremely flavorful, while my boyfriend got the Korean rice bowl, which was not bad but not quite to the standard of the other dishes in our opinion.

Our service was not fantastic and was the only downside of our meal. Although our server was ok, she was a little crass and borderline curt, something that I would expect from a local dive bar, but not a nicer place like this. At first I chalked it up to her being young and similar in age to us so she might have been more informal to be relatable, but at the end when we asked for the check, I wasn't sure if I had finished my meal enough to need a box. She said that she was either bring a box now or not coming back, which I thought was a little rude and out of nowhere. Of course she never came back to check on us after that either even though we were still dining for another 20 minutes. It was just a sour way to end an otherwise nice dinner for a special occasion.

I was also shocked and a little offended to see a 30% tip option. Tipping has gone out of control and the guilt of selecting a more reasonable tip amount puts customers in an uncomfortable place, especially when the service was not great.

I'd love to come back to try more of the menu because we had a nice experience in terms of the food and atmosphere, but I would hope to have a different server if I were to come back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENzRuTkFREAE,Charlotte,en

"I wasn't too impressed with the bahn mi, The bread was not crispy like most the reviews say. Pretty chewy consistency overall, bread goes a long way for a good bahn mi.

Weekends are for brunch and make sure you listen to the specials!
Elizabeth, our server, was amazing: friendly, respectful, she know all the plates and made some recommendations and was always ready to answer any questions we had.
We ordered a custard filled French toast as an appetizer but instead of vanilla, it had a lemon custard that was delicious! It came with caramel walnut that were delicious: they even had a little salt on them.
I had the breakfast nachos that featured home made chips, two eggs, pico, guac, black beans, etc. I asked that they add bacon to the mix because bacon makes the world go round!

Bad experience and wasted money. I ordered via Doordash and the food was not sealed or tamper proof packaging. Threw it in trash and warned my Twitter peeps. Sad this restaurant doesn't live in reality or simply doesn't care. Either way they are on their way to the dustbin of Charlotte history if they keep sending take-out orders packaged that way.

"I found myself craving chicken that was both tasty and affordable before I take off for my New York City adventure tomorrow. A couple of months back, I was suggested to check out Hubee D‚Äôs in Meyers Park. I'm all about supporting local spots, so I decided to check it out. Walking in, I was warmly greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter‚Äîwho turned out to be Mark, the owner. We got chatting, and he shared that he's originally from Jersey and boldly claims his chicken could rival any in town. I admire his confidence and passion for his food! Mark, with his rich background in the restaurant industry, dreams of opening a northern-style deli/luncheonette/breakfast spot in the future.

Since this was my first visit, Mark suggested trying something from their menu of scratch-made chicken entrees, including tenders, nuggets, sandwiches, wings, salads, and wraps.

With so much to choose from, I settled on a fried chicken sandwich with pickles and their signature zesty Hubee Sauce‚Äîreminiscent of Zaxby's Chicken Sauce‚Äîalongside a serving of well-seasoned matchstick French fries and creamy mac & cheese with a white cheddar sauce. Everything was made to order, arriving hot and fresh. When comparing Hubee D‚Äôs fried chicken sandwich to that famous chain that's closed on Sundays, Hubee D‚Äôs takes the crown. The chicken was perfectly breaded and fried‚Äîjuicy and crispy. The Hubee sauce added just the right touch without being overpowering, and the bun was perfectly toasted, with the pickles providing a refreshing contrast.

While I usually lean towards baked mac & cheese, Hubee D‚Äôs saucy, creamy version was a delightful surprise.  So, if saucy mac & cheese is your thing, don't miss out on this one.
If you've driven past this local gem without stopping, make sure to bring the family next time. There‚Äôs something for everyone to enjoy! I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Hubee D‚Äôs!

P.S. Sorry for the half-eaten meal photo. I got caught up chatting with Mark and didn't want my food to cool down.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENmRpZlp3EAE,Charlotte,en

"Wow!! Amazing restaurant and we have been many many time!! Not sure why I have reviewed sooner.

We had a lovely lunch this past Monday and the outdoor dining area is fantastic!! We normally sit inside, but had our puppy with us and the outside was so pleasant.

Our food has always been top notch! We have tried many different dishes but come back to some of our favorites- this lunch was the max burger, dry rub wings and fries. All worthy contenders and perfect for a lunch!! I love the devil crab stuffed fish for dinner and my wife likes the bolognese. We have taken friends and none have ever been disappointed.

We have had some good servers and some just ok ones. Personally I love their tea and usually drink 3 glasses during the course of my meal. If my glass ever gets fully empty that is a red flag of poor performance in my opinion, unfortunately that has happened on most occasions.

"First time guests last night. Saw the recent negative reviews but decided to make my own assessment.
Turns out they‚Äôre accurate.

Service was sub-par. None of the staff looked like they even wanted to be there. Our server for some reason seemed irritated at what all of us ordered‚Ä¶why? Lol
The meatballs looked and tasted like they were frozen from a bag. The sauce was alright though.
Bread and ‚Äúgreat olive oil‚Äù was far from great.
The Caesar was dry, and had 1 little anchovy on it. Pizza was ok.
The cacio e Pepe was wayyyyy undercooked and the cheese clumped (cheap ingredients)
And all of it was definitely overpriced for the quality.
However, the octopus was probably some of the best I‚Äôve had in awhile.

I like the open kitchen but I still wouldn‚Äôt go back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5OGFqU05REAE,Charlotte,en

"Ordered online with Uber eats and went to pick up at the time they told me. My order wasn‚Äôt made for another 20+ minutes. While I was waiting the fries were sitting in the bag getting cold.
When the order was finally handed to me I asked if he can check if the fries are hot or not and to replace them if they are cold. The employee got an attitude with me saying ‚Äòwe make sure the fries stay under the heat lamps‚Äô and I responded ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been standing here for 20 minutes and I can tell you that they were not under the heat lamps and sitting in the bag‚Äô
He then replied ‚Äòwell we are backed up and I can‚Äôt do anything about it, you can just go online and say something there‚Äô
Upon getting home the fries were NOT hot and the burgers were made so sloppily and packaged without care that the burgers fell apart after one bite making it almost impossible to finish.
Spent $31 on 2 burgers and fries and got the worst service I‚Äôve had in a very long time.

"Service was over and beyond my expectations, the price was worth the quality of my meal, I was asked if everything was made to my satisfaction.
I felt everything was designed to meet desired food and dinning experience . This location surpassed the typical restaurant standard of service a customer would experience since the decline of the restaurant  industry as a whole post-covid, some of the staff members such as Jayden and Stephanie checked on me multiple times to ensure my order was correct and if there was anymore they could provide. This was my first visit to a smashburger and introduction to its menu or top notch service. I would recommend this location not only for its service and quality of food, but, most importantly, the cleanliness. Keep up the hard work. I will make sure to stop in anytime I'm in the area. This location will make it harder to want to waste my money on the contaminated slop the competition has to offer. The quality of food and service is a reflection of the pride the staff has for there establishment, which sadly is becomming a thing of the the past.

"Brixx is definitely a good way to go if you are craving a bit of everything.  This one is located in Dilworth, and it is on the smaller side from their parking to seating inside. It can get crowded. We went on a Friday right at 5pm, and it was still empty, and thankfully so as there were 8 of us. Everything was great in the beginning. Our drinks, appetizers, and food were delivered in a timely manner. Towards the middle of us bring there the dinner crowd did come rushing in which caused our waitress to I believe get fairly overwhelmed. We basically had to hunt her down for everything, straws, refills, cream, and sugar for coffee and even utensils. At one point, we just didn't feel like having to call her over or even wait any longer that we just decided to op out of ordering anything else and just leave. The food, though, was amazing as always.

"Blanche Reynold's mansion holds significant historical value, much like many other establishments in the Myers Park area. The mansion features items imported from Cuba in the 1920s, adding to its cultural richness. Opting to park in the lot on Fenton Place rather than the one off Providence, especially the back parking lot, is advisable. The expansive patio offers a charming outdoor space, yet navigating the premises can be intricate, particularly when entering from the rear parking lot. Despite the establishment's reputation for its drinks and margaritas, the margarita experience fell short of expectations. It appears that my margarita (pitcher of Friend Zone) may have been non-alcoholic or contained minimal alcohol content. The perceived lack of value for the $42 expenditure is disappointing, as the drink resembled a mere juice consumption experience. I deeply regret not opting for the bottle of wine instead. The Billy Ray Valentine, however, proved to be exceptional. The enhanced queso dip, complimented by chorizo and sweet relish corn, was a culinary delight. The chicken fajitas (I'm Your Wingman), accompanied by cilantro lime rice, spring mix, queso, black beans, and sour cream, were a standout dish. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge in the tres leches dessert, but it undoubtedly would have been delightful. The service provided by Adrianna was exemplary! Notably, the establishment does not provide straws, so it is advisable to bring your own if needed. I am taking off 2 stars for the Margarita Pitcher.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeko3QmR3EAE,Charlotte,en

The three amigos appetizer which has fresh tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa, and queso was good. The guac could use some salt, and the queso is very thin, but like any other cheese thickened as it cooled. The Tacos and quesadilla were good as well. I had the ""Gaylord Focker"" which taste like the chef went foraging for the ingredients then put them right on the  tortilla. The ""Lookin good Louis"" taco was good as well. My Wife had the ""You're my boy blue"" quesadilla and she liked it as well.

"Hands down one of the best seafood spots in Charlotte! The quality of food here is way better than one of those Asian restaurants. Crablegs are bigger, signature butter sauce taste like it‚Äôs made with crack‚Ä¶. Haven‚Äôt had a rich butter sauce with seafood since seafood connection closed. Pricing is on point with the market and isn‚Äôt any cheaper or more expensive than other seafood restaurants. However, they do offer daily/ weekly specials which can be attractive if you are on a budget. I can see parking being an issue, but I can say I‚Äôve never experienced it- always in and out! I don‚Äôt care for showing my ID for my order, cashier really attempted to not give me my already paid for food without it, but the cook OK‚Äôd it as I am a regular weekly customer. The signage is clearly posted in the establishment, so they technically have legs to stand on with that rule, so just remember to have it if you order online. Overall, it‚Äôs a great establishment and I will continue to patronize.

Edit: I came back to say, although the food is good- the establishment obstacles to obtain the food is similar to the Olympics (just joking), but ordering can be challenging. So I already mentioned the ID requirement to pick up food you paid for already. Specials are advertised in the store, but you can only pay cash for it. So if you stop by and decide you want a special item along with something else, they make you produce 2 different forms of payment- card payment for menu items, then cash for the special items. No cash- you will denied the special or told to go get cash. There‚Äôs no phone orders availability, so if you want them while your on the road, be prepared to pull over, check to see if you have valid ID on you, then place the order online if the site is working (it froze on me twice trying to enter my payment method). Makes me kinda miss establishments that wants to service the community and made it easy to patron.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXFlM2R3EAE,Charlotte,en

The platter has crab legs and shrimp, corn, sausage, etc ... Just didn't taste like much outside of butter to be honest. The crab Alfredo was basic, my son is in culinary and his Alfredo has more flavor. Theirs tastes like boiled pasta, cheap jar Alfredo and that's it... If the flavor gave what the looks did, it would've been a 10/10. If they came up with their own seasoning to mix with the butter it would be .",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5eTVxcWZBEAE,Charlotte,en

"I‚Äôll preface this by saying I was a server and bartender all through college in several restaurants -

My girlfriend and I sat in the dining room, server walked over, dropped 1 menu and didn‚Äôt say anything. I informed him there would be 3 of us and he just left the single menu to return later with still no menus or introduction or words at all‚Ä¶  just sort of stood there as if to say ‚Äúok I‚Äôm listening‚Äù but never really spoke.

We moved to the bar side and received slightly better service but still no introduction, very few words, I had to assert myself to order anything before the server walked away. I imagine they‚Äôre probably missing out on plenty of revenue from no upselling and hardly any communication at all

Food was ok, service extremely slow, was not very busy either. It‚Äôs a shame this place is suffering from such weak leadership, we were excited to try it.

"I got takeout for my family.  The person over was extremely nice and very helpful with my order.  When I got to the restaurant my food was packed and ready to go and the cashier was happy to add a drink for me.

The atmosphere when I entered was very in line with their sign saying they'd been open since 1933.  The lighting was perfect.  Everything was clean and I'd say half of your meal was the experience of eating there.

We got a burger with onion rings, chicken tenders with fries, and quesadillas with sweet potato fries, and two cheeseburger sliders.  The total was about $70.  So about $15 per meal and $10 for the sliders.  Which is pretty much in line with food from a restaurant these days.

I enjoyed my sweet potato fries.  I did need to add a little salt.  My quesadilla was enjoyable but not great.   I would ask for the salsa and sour cream to be separate because they were together. It also could have been crispier and had more than just cheese and chicken.  I did ask for chicken and steak but it was just chicken.

My mother-in-law enjoyed her cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and mushrooms.  She enjoyed her meal and ate her leftovers.

My husband got chicken tenders with fries.  The fries he called ok.  He didn't eat them all and didn't finish them later.  We did hear them up and they would have been better fresh I think.  There were a lot of tenders about six.  They were thin for restaurant tenders and my husband said they were over cooked.  He called them passable but did eat the rest later so they were edible.

We got onions that nobody ate.  They looked a little burnt.  The sliders were your common sliders they weren't anything special but they were cooked well.

I would recommend eating in because the food would have been better fresh and I think the restaurant's atmosphere would have made up for the ok food.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONHIzZ2J3EAE,Charlotte,en

"My first time trying this place. Let me say that the food was delish. My issue is that the staff were in the dining area having curse filled conversations like they were at home among friends. Not even a patron who drank too much but the staff. I found it unprofessional and a bit insulting that it didn't occur to them that I didn't want to hear b-words, f-bombs & other crude language while trying to enjoy my Fri after work much less their silly & inane conversation.

It was extremely off-putting so I'm unlikely to go back & other locations aren't convenient enough for me to want to drive there. I'm at a loss to understand why mgmt would allow them to stand around where patrons are & can easily overhear every word they're saying. I have to assume they're okay with it because clearly the person I assumed was the mgr as he stopped & asked about my food could see & hear too because they were right there. Then, there was the one who came from the kitchen and slouched across one of the seats while he talked on his cell. Yep could hear his convo too.

The burger & my server who was not part of the group congregated near me were great, but the atmosphere they created made my Fri afterwork outing quite unpleasant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENGJiblhREAE,Charlotte,en

This is not your normal chillis experience. This is a quick serve disguised as a restaurant. You order from your phone and a server brings it to you table and then you pay from your phone. They say drinks are refillable but good luck ever seeing someone to ask for a refill. Prices are gouged. Probably the most expensive burgers in the airport.

Basically, customer service here is poor and unprofessional and unreliable. They are obvious when it comes to ignoring your questions or concerns. The women up front have an attitude majority of the time. They will talk smack about you once you walk away whether they helped you or ignored you and just stood there aimlessly when you‚Äôre trying to talk to them.

"I hate these kind of reviews.

Hostess waved across the room to seat me, no instructions. I sit quietly for several minutes waiting on someone to take my order. A server shows up with no water or coffee. She informs me i have to order online via QR code. (Why have a server?) QR code menu doesn't match the advertising. Said advertisement is why I stopped to eat. You have to order and pay online while still expected to tip a server. Online payment portal messed up. Server told me I didn't pay for coffee. I apologized. I went back into the payment portal and reentered my info and card info to pay for the coffee. The portal now wants to charge me for two coffees. I ask the server to just take the coffee away. She does. She returns to say I've already paid for the coffee and can bring it back. Sigh. I decline, choosing to eat dryly some food I didn't want in the first place just to get on with my life.

Look at my reviews. I'm not given to negativity. But this restaurant ----.  You don't have the right culture. Your process is unfriendly, frustrating, and borderline combative.

"I paid nearly $16 for a burrito with scrambled eggs and overly fried tater torts. The expectation when you buy a meal in an airport is that it will be inflated in price and underwhelming, so that wasn't the issue. However, there were no employees at the front of house taking orders at the register. There were a couple of kiosks where I first tried to place my order, but the item I wanted to order came with bacon and there was no option to remove this on the kiosk. I waited for about 5 minutes for someone to come out and help me with my order. When the employee finally did come out she asked ""did everyone order at the kiosk?"" When I said I did not she said ""okay order at the kiosk."" Then walked away again. Then I waited a little longer for her to come back. I then explained I needed to request no bacon on the burrito I was trying to order and there was no option to do this on the kiosk. She verbally confirmed and walked away. So I went ahead and placed the order at the kiosk and it came out with no bacon, but also no pico de Gallo. So overall, very poor customer service and the staff, and an incorrect, overpriced, order.

Several seated close by seemed to being enjoying their meals as well, with one commenting how tasty my burger looked . . . and it did.
The service at the bar (which was not overly busy) was only average, bordering on weak.  There wasn't much I needed, but I've appreciated that opportunity to order another drink.

Whether you're craving their classic chicken sandwich, their crispy nuggets, or their mouthwatering waffle fries, Chick-fil-A never disappoints. Plus, their commitment to customer satisfaction shines through in every interaction.

"One of my most disappointing experiences with Chick-fil-A occurred recently. Despite having placed numerous large catering orders at various locations in the past, I was shocked by the smaller size of my recent order and the multitude of issues it caused. I placed the order earlier in the day for pickup that evening on the 15th for a party. However, upon arriving at 7:45-7:50 for the 7:30 pickup window, my order was nowhere to be found. When I addressed the issue with the managers and team lead, I was met with a lack of care and attention. Overhearing the assistant general manager and a team lead speaking in Spanish (possibly assuming I didn't understand), I was dismayed to hear them dismiss the situation, claiming it wasn't a big deal because they hadn't seen my order. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, another team lead informed me that it would take another 15-20 minutes to thaw the bread for the sandwiches I ordered, or I could opt for wraps instead. Reluctantly, I agreed to change my order to expedite the process. Finally, an hour past the confirmed pickup time, I received my order, causing me to miss most of the party I was attending. All I received in return for this frustrating experience was an offer for a free milkshake or meal.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa0tEbW9RRRAB,Dallas,en

"We went to dinner at the Grill and Vine restaurant as a party of seven on April 8th. Five of the people were satisfied with their meal, but my daughter and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad, which was extremely sparse. It had virtually no quinoa, possibly one cut up apricot and one cut up cucumber and dressing that was advertised as curry, but tasted like pure oil. The kale was very hard and inedible. Each of us was charged $16 for our salads which amounted to $32. We were both extremely disappointed and upset but were hosting guests from out of town and did not want to complain or have to wait 20 minutes for new dinners if we ordered them. It was already a long wait to get our food originally. I am extremely upset and no one is getting back to me from management. My voicemail is sitting ignored. I offered to scan and send a copy of our receipt so they could give me a refund which be would be a small portion of what we spent  I am looking for a refund for those two salads .Wish me luck.

"I visited Grill and Vine at the Westin Downtown Dallas and had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food and menu items were subpar, my server didn‚Äôt know in-depth about any items on the menu, but those things were not a big deal. When my check comes for $220, I give my card and the server comes back saying that only $160 was deducted and that I still owe the additional $60. So I check my account, things are all good so I give back my card to charge the rest. They then charge me an additional $180 and are saying I still owe more money. Seeing that I‚Äôve already been charged $340 for a $220 bill I immediately go to the manager bc it makes no sense whatsoever. The manager proceeds to tell me that the card reader automatically charged the amount of $180 and he doesn‚Äôt know why. In what world does a card reader charge random amounts? You would have to type in the amount owed to be charged.

While trying to see what‚Äôs going on and get my money back, Louis Almassy comes over and immediately tells me to calm down, calls me aggressive, and threatens to call the authorities on me without even knowing what‚Äôs going on or why I‚Äôm upset about being overcharged. He continued to call me aggressive and threatened to call the cops on me all for being upset about money being taken from me. I didn‚Äôt appreciate being called names and being threatened with cops for simply just calling out being overcharged.

I truly believe that I was only threatened with the cops being called because I‚Äôm black as there was nothing happening that warranted a cop being involved when again, money was taken from ME. Louis saw a black man upset and immediately pegged me as the problem without even getting an understanding of the situation. Even after getting an understanding, he never apologized for threatening to call the cops.

Furthermore, Louis is a loss prevention manager which ‚Äúprotects a company's assets from fraud and theft‚Äù, why would I be reprimanded by him when I‚Äôm the one in need of help? This dining experience was by far the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkZ2Fqcll3EAE,Dallas,en
"I booked this venue for Valentine‚Äôs Day with my wife. $85 per person is reasonable so I booked it. We were greeted promptly and politely by the hostess. The restaurant was basically empty, which made me wonder why the booking time was so limited. It took a few minutes to be greeted and offered drinks, but the bar was busy so we understood. When we placed our order, we watched our drinks sit on the bar for 8 minutes before my wife got up and got them for us. When it came time to order from the fixed menu, I was concerned when they didn‚Äôt ask what temperature I wanted my filet. Come to find out, it‚Äôs only well done. They brought out my plate with mushrooms, some sort of potato, and a thin filet cooked WELL DONE. It was painfully obvious the steak was premade and microwaved to order. My wife got scallops and risotto, the scallops had a strong fishy smell to them, which is NOT in the norm. I sent my steak back to be prepared medium rare as a filet should be. The product they returned to me was BLUE RARE at best. At this point, I was annoyed. So I asked them to return the food and bring us our check. I gladly paid for my wife‚Äôs meal since she tolerated the scallops. The oxtail pie appetizer was bland, and the cappuccino tomato soup starter was good, but was maybe an ounce. To top it off, they brought h wife her dessert and sent back mine since I returned my meal, and requested it to be removed (I took one bite of my well done steak). While I understand they shouldn‚Äôt just hand stuff out, they should have at least made an effort to remedy the poor food quality. I don‚Äôt blame the server at all. Either way, I paid $113 for my wife‚Äôs meal that was mediocre at best. The risotto was bland and overcooked along with the overly fishy scallops. I hope management fixes this for future diners. Luckily, we found an Italian place down the street to eat.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkMXQzRERREAE,Dallas,en

This 2nd visit, I had the Oxtails, Cabbage and Green Beans. The sides were still great, but the oxtails lacked flavor‚Ä¶literally no flavor‚Ä¶almost like they‚Äôd been just sitting in water. I guess the good thing about the oxtails is, they were really tender, which did allow me to pull the meat off the bones and add some seasonings.

"Henry's Majestic: A Disaster From Start to Finish

Starving after Church, Service Left Us Praying for Salvation

We arrived at Henry's Majestic with high hopes after hearing good things, only to be met with a nightmare of a dining experience. Let's just say our Easter celebration went from holy to ""holy moly, this place is bad!""

Reservations Don't Mean Reservations

Despite having a reservation, our party of ten (including restless kids) waited a soul-crushing **hour and a half** for our food. By the time it arrived, we were famished and past the point of polite conversation.

A Sticky Situation (Literally)

A quick trip to the men's room did little to improve our mood. The floor was a disgusting tribute to those who came before us, leaving a lingering question about the overall cleanliness of the establishment.

Food? More Like a Food Quest

The agonizing wait for our entrees wasn't the end of the saga. After finally getting our food, it took another **45 minutes** just to receive a measly dessert.  Apparently, patience is a key ingredient at Henry's Majestic, because you'll need it in biblical proportions.

The Kitchen Gods Said ""No"" to My Friend's Meal

One member of our party never even received their dinner! Two whole hours vanished, and poof, no food appeared. The waiter's excuse of a ""busy Easter rush"" was laughable considering we had reservations. Shouldn't they have been prepared for a holiday crowd?

The Service? Non-Existent

Our waiter, Sam, tried his best, but  it wasn't enough to salvage this disaster.  There were no apologies, no attempt to fix the situation, just an acceptance of defeat.

The Last Supper (We Wish!)

This experience left a worse taste in our mouths than last year's fruitcake. Henry's Majestic is a place we'll be avoiding like the plague.  Save yourself the frustration and your hard-earned cash ‚Äì take your Easter celebration elsewhere.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcV82Sjd3RRAB,Dallas,en

"Very disappointing experience at this restaurant. My family was visiting from out of town and heard good things about this place. We walked in after spending the morning at the Dallas aquarium. We ordered a burger, wedge salad, hot dog, and chicken sandwich. It took about an hour for all our food to come out and at three separate times. My son‚Äôs burger was brought out first (by mistake from another table‚Äôs order) and our server ended up saying he could keep it and our food would be out shortly. About 20 minutes later by the time my son was finished my salad arrived. We were still missing my husband and daughter‚Äôs food. I went ahead and ate my salad and when I was finishing my lunch the rest of the food arrived. This was about 45 minutes after our order had been placed and the restaurant was not busy by any means. The hot dog had mustard on it which we had told the server to omit when we placed our order. When asked if we could get a new hot dog with just ketchup as originally ordered and keep the fries (our daughter was so hungry at this point) the server seemed annoyed. She brought us a new hot dog within a few minutes‚Ä¶drowning in ketchup, about 3 times the amount that was on the original hot dog, looking sloppy and gross overall. They were clearly annoyed we had requested a new one. This place has a fun overall bar atmosphere and an area for a live band.

First order was phenomenal. Tried the beef Quesabirria and it was so good I pulled over to eat half of it in the car. 2nd order a couple weeks later was dry and didn't see the guac was missing until I got home. 3rd time not much better. Today was my very last time trying. Again missing part of the order (simply no guacamole included) that I was charged for. The container was sideways in the bag (didn't know) and leaked all over the car.

I had one steak taco and one shrimp taco. The steak was good. Seasoned well. I feel like for the price it should have been more special. I didn't even finish the shrimp taco. I feel like it should have been cooked a little bit longer to give it more texture. And again literally nothing special about it. A dab of guacamole a dab of Pico and that was it.

Well, my son and I finally found the time and stopped in.I have been trying to find something positive to say about my experience at the Buena Vista restaurant. The only thing that I could come up with is the staff was very friendly. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with the food. My son ordered the beef fajitas, they were pretty flavorless. Not even any salt or pepper. I tried the grilled chicken. It was dry and tough. My meal also came with a sour cream chicken enchilada. The enchilada was hard with minimal sauce. But the staff was very friendly. They came by numerous times to check on us but I didn't know how to explain why the food was so unappetizing. When we received the bill it was for over $50 plus tip.

I don't even write reviews. I don't have the time for that mess but imma surely make time for this one. First of all it's tacobell there's no real expectation for fast food. Still when you can't even throw some beans and cheese on a tortilright there's some issues. That definitely needs to be addressed. All I wanted was a few simple burritos. And what I got was that crap I ordered a chicken enchilada burrito and I only got a few small slivers of chicken. I don't understand how that passes as a proper made chicken enchiladas burrito. Especially given the fact you have a menu to guide you and a specific measurement scoop to give the exact amount everytime.that is wrong and disrespectful in so many levels.look I get it it i really do sometimes you just may not have the right amount to make the proper portion of an item pulled or maybe just out of stock. But that don't mean that you can make a person believe that they will be getting what they ordered. All I got was a rice and cheese with red sauce burrito. you couldve just said we dont have that item available at this time not make people pay for it anyway. You took my money and just slapped crap into a tortilla knowing thats not at all what i paid for WRONG AND UNPROFESSIONAL. There's a difference of making mistakes and just down right not doing it right just because you just dont care. If your gonna do it do it right or not at all not a recommended  place to eat at,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5X3VTcXdBRRAB,Dallas,en

"By far my worst experience with any pizza hut. We accepted the 1 hour wait time. When the delivery guy (later identified as a PH worker vs door dash per the store worker after calling back) came, we were given 2 boxes and a wings container. One pizza box was entirely EMPTY! Who in their right mind seals an empty box and then also doesn't notice how EMPTY it feels?

After calling back. The worker offered to either get a redelivery (an extra hour wait ) or store credit. The 1 star given was for the store worker who offered a credit in an amount more than the product that we ordered, which is fair due to the inconvenience and hunger my family endured after not receiving the amount of food we prepared for. Thank you store worker for making it a bit better and for apologizing on behalf of the business.

"Upon meeting the main Manager MITCH.  I was met with
hostility.
There's a severe lack of leadership in this
place. I've been to this place for 20 yrs or more but
it's gone downhill. No lobby open to the public.
The
mgr is confrontational. No teaching, training or
motivating the workers. No ethical practices. No I
won't be supporting this restaurant until there's
changes for the better by hiring general managers
who take care of their employees and give
opportunities to better themselves.

How you can hire someone with a disability and then work them a million hours and because there's a complaint,  And you have a million complaints even before this especially on Yourself, which YOU failed to inquire about from the person it's against, or even TRY to provide additional training, YOU SUCK AS A LEADER! And then to just remove them without even a conversation refusing to answer calls or texts and even a courtesy to let them go.
You are a weak cowardly person who doesn't deserve the title of Manager.
To be hostile and not hear the concerns of the guardian is even worse. You didn't do me a favor by coming over and ""allowing"" me to sit in the locked down lobby.

I'd love to have a conversation with the owner of this place regarding American disability Act!

"Didn't even want to give one star but it wouldn't let me post otherwise. I have never been to any fast food location that is this careless about service and food. 1. I specifically went because I wanted a breakfast burrito. Well I was told we're out of all the breakfast food. Not the first time every time I go for breakfast they don't have any breakfast. Lots of time even in the mornings they are out of most breakfast items. Anyways I went ahead and got the #7 Buttery Jack with curly fries. Get to the window and the young man was not hateful, but not welcoming. There were a few young ladies in there all laughing and talking loud, music being played very loud. The atmosphere was almost like you weren't wanted & were an inconvenience to them. But the food, the meat is hard, cold not warm at all, and the fries are cold and so hard you can hardly chew them. The only thing worth having was the Dr.Pepper I got. I will never go back to this location again. I paid almost $14 just to have to go down the street to Whataburger and pay for something else.

I rated this place low unfortunately because of a disrespectful lying manager (Hispanic decent) and her disrespectful co-worker (white lady who thinks she is black). I mentioned their race for a reason. I had a pick up order. Grabbed my food and opened the bag to see if the fries was cold because order was done at 3:00 I walked in at 3:06. While opening the bag the employee was giving me a dirty look so I said I‚Äôm just trying to see if my fries are hot. She then says you good we just put it up there. I continued with checking and just as I thought they were cold. I POLITELY said ma‚Äôam may I please have a fresh order of fries. She rolled her eyes and said they are fresh. I politely said no they are not. She takes the fries I take a seat. The manager comes over and says they can‚Äôt give me fresh fries because the order was fine. I tell the manager I just tasted it and it‚Äôs cold and since I paid for it want them hot. The manger continues to be defiant and disrespectful. I said I‚Äôm not leaving without hot fries. The employee brings new fries (I‚Äôm sure she just redropped but whatever I don‚Äôt care they hot. I ask for DM manger number. They gave a card. I go to the car call the number and the manger who I just got into it with answered. Now this lady lied and assured me it was the right number. All of this was unnecessary and stupid. They only had to give me fresh fries that‚Äôs it. Turned into a real situation and if I wasn‚Äôt smart with self control things could have went left. I‚Äôm still going to file that complaint!

"I was very hesitant to try this place because of the bad reviews I saw; at the same time I want to try it for myself and see for myself. First impression: a very old & dirty fried chicken restaurant, a step down from Lisa‚Äôs Chicken. The price is relatively fair, quite competitive to other fried chicken places. I was able to get a 3pc chicken dinner (2 sides) and a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù drink for under $10. The chicken tasted very bland, very greasy and left a bad after taste. I believe they‚Äôve used rotten chicken to fry, very gross, and don‚Äôt even get me started with their soggy fries I couldn‚Äôt even finish. The drink is not up to its size. I got the medium one ($1.59) and it is very clearly not 24 oz as advertised. It is more like 16 oz. They fill it up with ice so you don‚Äôt get the full volume of drink, and they would charge you 50 cents for refill. Because of how this restaurant offers dirt poor quality of food, I was going to give it a 1-star review. However, an extra star rating was given by me because they let me get the refill for free. Not a place to return.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKb3U3MXhnRRAB,Dallas,en

The day previous to this review I went and got the Caniac to go and when I got to work it was short 2 pieces of chicken. Called and they immediately said come back and we'll make it right. Now the reason I decided to make the review is due to the manager who stepped in when I got there today. Some managers and fast food establishments like to stand around and make themselves look important at times. Jy however evidently is more concerned about customer service and correcting errors that his team caused. He didn't just say make the food for me he did it himself to make sure it was done right. That's some pretty good customer service and a way to step up to show how important customer service should be to everybody. Good job sir!,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkZ3JfaU13EAE,Dallas,en

However, to have to open individual containers to make sure the chicken was there is going too bit much babysitting. We should expect a certain amount of quality. And the place wasn't even that busy today... The drive thru wasn't long and the dining area was not full.

"We frequent there ... but no more... we put up with the not-so-enthusiastic attitudes because we enjoy the cauliflower pizza. Today they overcharged us, they passed us off to someone else to correct the cashier/pizza maker mistake. I noticed they didn't refund the sales tax which was 5ish dollars.
He stated he didn't know how to refund the tax. So I asked for a manager, and he said they couldn't reach them anymore for the evening. They have poor communication skills, work slowly, and will not make eye contact.
To the person who refunded us the money I checked my bank account, and it does refund the whole amount with sales tax despite the refund receipt provided.
I really cannot understand why the staff are not trained in customer service nor have access to call their manager to straighten or provide education around the refund procedures. I couldn't be more disappointed with this location.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0OS1UZF9nRRAB,Dallas,en

So I'm not some ""KAREN"" making waves. The tall male bartender needs to either be replaced IMMEDIATELY! He is the driest most rude bartender that I've ever encountered.

The waitress brought out the Crab before it was cooked..I didn't realize how big it was but I got it any way. It was absolutely delicious .  The Okra was perfectly cooked, it still had a little bit of a crisp bite so it wasn't as slimy as you would think. The fried Calamari was cooked perfectly as well, it came with spicy mayo, which we enjoyed as well. I mean even the white rice was good. The customer service was impeccable as well. Overall a great dining experience.  Thank you yo all the staff that assisted us.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdkkzcUdREAE,New York,en

"1 star for the manager, 5 stars for the young servers who were friendly & 5stars for the food-esp flavor of the mackerel lunch box and just love the steam eggs that came w it.

Unfortunately 2 things occurred that was not acceptable in my book-a ladybug in my salad and the manager that approached us to insulting say we weren‚Äôt allowed to pack the leftovers that were specially priced. What??!  There were three of us for a speedy  lunch on a friday work day  that amounted to $150! We added 2 orders of the specials and the rest were regular priced items. They should have a sign informing diners of their no packing leftovers policy. Absolutely INSULTING AND OBNOXIOUSLY DONE!

"TWO THINGS:

Don't ever come and tell someone how much to tip you when there's no mandatory tip, but only suggestions like every other bill in this country. Especially when services are mediocre at best.

Secondly, don't ever add suggested tips on the total bill. It is always before taxes.

This is the FIRST ever restaurant I've been to in my life that comes back and asks for more tip, and the first one I've noticed that add their suggested tip box on the total after tax. Life is hard as it is already, don't scam people.

I was certainly surprised to say the least by that. Who on earth does that? WOW.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdDktS3pBRRAB,New York,en

"Parking: There is a nearby parking lot for $3/hour (maximum of 3 hours). There is street/metered parking (difficult to find).

We discovered this place after deciding not to wait on the waitlist for Szechuan Mountain House.

Service: Service was good. We were greeted and seated immediately.

Atmosphere: I really liked the decor/ambiance. Really clean/modern look.

Food: The portion sizes were rather small and on the more expensive end. We ordered various dishes and the presentation of the food was great.

Abalone - This was good. Had a citrus taste to it. The price of this was discounted when we went (not sure if this will remain at a discounted price for future visits)

Dragon Maki - Tasted good but nothing above and beyond. Comparable to any other sushi restaurant.

Agedashi Tofu - This was good. Again, nothing above and beyond. Can get this anywhere and will be comparable.

Takoyaki - Underwhelming. The bottom of the ball appeared to be flat.

Tori Karaage - Underwhelming. Can get fried chicken anywhere.

Lava Stone A5 Wagyu - The meat was tender but was tasteless. Portion size was really small and definitely not worth the $36. Better off getting 2-3 more rolls instead of this.

Oyako Don - Underwhelming. Nothing stood out and you wont be missing out if you go anywhere else that offers this.

Seafood Yaki Udon - This was good. The sauce was good. It wasnt too oily. Definitely above average for udon.

Ice Cream - Complementary at the end. This was also good. Only had the options of matcha or vanilla.

Verdict: I would recommend coming here to try it out however this is definitely not the spot to go to if you are looking for dinner/something to fill you up. Place is more like a spot for lunch.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOZ2N5SUx3EAE,New York,en

The valet people have extremely bad attitude.  They had many spots in the early morning.  We said we could pull to a spot that they wanted us to park as it would take 6 of us with a kid to get off the car and take our belongings.  The valet guy immediately yelled at us and asked us to get off the car.  No one was behind us at that time. We were nicely asking if we could park and we would still give tips.

Welp I hit my 600K now Can ya'll the original number goal I had in my head ????
Hint I didn't hit it yet....

@kendrickclone70 and I spent the day on some going to see our doctors to make sure our health is on point. And coming out one of our appointments we notice this restaurant across the street @aromarestaurantt which is listed Aroma Restaurant and Sushi Bar as we are reading the menu in the window. And the Teriyaki Chicken caught our eyes. So we pulled up.
As we are seated by a latin waitress with a nice size BBL I look around the restaurant and all the waitresses are latin with BBL's BBL's. Now I am wondering is BBL's mandatory for them to get a job there. We ordered both our Teriyaki Chicken and when they came out plated so nice. And the food was delicious. And what actually brings this restaurant over the top for me was not the BBL's and the abundance of latin woman.
The top for me was the simple glass of water. The water was a ice cold and even though it was in a cocktail glass our waitresses yes waitresses kept my glass refilled over and over and over. I added the lime and by the time I was finished eating my slow self lunch my mucous (pause) was no longer bothering me in my chest.

"This place is definitely one of my favorites in NYCü•∞ü•∞ü§©... even when I visit other places in the city, I tend to finish my nights at this restaurant because of their music and their pretty affordable appetizers and drinks (which are good-good).

It's really weird to me to find mixed reviews over here, considering my friends, clients and myself never had an issue with them. I'd suggest you try these type of places by yourself, because you never know the two sides of a story.

Aroma has always delivered the best service no matter the crowd, the day nor the time. And I'm a regular there, so I know what I'm talking about.ü§ó

Overall, it is a safe and clean restaurant with great vibes and ambiance, their music selection is always fiiiirrreeee  THE FOOD: absolutely delicious, and if your a wine lover , they have a wide variety of world renowned brands and amazingly good cocktails. Try the margaritas and the Passion Fruit juice, sooo good... Specially the tamarindo mojito and the Jumbo Rainbow margarita, one of those and you'll be set!

If you're into pasta, order their Penne a la Vodka, the lobster ravioli or their Seafood Fra Diavolo ü•∞. From the appetizers menu, I recommend the fried shumai, mofongo trios, the quesadilla, the Spring rolls, and finally the cheese and spinach empanadas.

Also, make sure to order sushi, IT'S THE BEST in the area! and actually one of the best in the city, for an unbeatable price. My favorite sushi rolls are ""Nemo Roll"" and ""Aroma Roll"" (those are a little spicy).

"I was looking for a place nearby for sushi, and I found this place, which is very close. I tried it out, and it was delicious. Quick service. Tonight 12/24/19 I stopped by for a sushi dinner and shrimp shumai. When I got home I had sashimi, with brown rice in a plastic container. The shumai was the only thing they got right. Partially my fault for not checking it first. I have changed from 5 to two stars. Gave them one more try. That's the last picture I posted. That eel at the bottom of the photo. It was rubbery, very rubbery. I'm pretty sure it also has to do with the location. You're probably going to find quality sushi at a place you're spending top dollar. I will not choose Saki II next time. Or just take a train ride to 51st in Manhattan to Nippori. I need to add that even though their sushi is not up to standards, I have never tried anything from their cooked menu. Good luck 5/14/22 I have to commend you on your latest maki and sushi, because it was very flavorful and fresh, but hold on and take a close look at the fake lobster that came in your seafood delight. Unbelievable! Do you really think that passes for lobster? I thought that I would give the cooked menu a try and you shock me with this! Nobody's perfect but trying to pass this as lobster is ridiculous!!!!

I had a hankering for tostadas and My elder came with tinga, which is spicy chicken. Tostadas are dry tortillas loaded with beans lettuce tomatoes maybe peppers, cheese and your choice of meat. The best thing about tostadas is that you have to eat them fresh because they tend to absorb the moisture from the food and can break apart in your hands. You eat them like you would eat a small pizza and I really enjoyed these tostadas. The service was very good and this place has been here a while and does a lot of takeout.

Ok so I just came here for the first time yesterday (Sunday). The actual dining area is fairly small but clean. We found a table pretty easy. Atmosphere was very Mexican and interesting. The waitress(/busboy/dishwasher) came to us promptly and gave us the paper menu. The writing on it was so small and the place so dimly lit that I had to pull out my flashlight to read it (no big deal). We asked for 4 different juices and every time she came back to tell us they didn't have that. We finally settled for mango smoothies and our food order. Food came out and we didn't see the waitress for the remainder of our meal. I had to ask three times for water before she came with the carafe and two glasses. Her demeanor was dry and not friendly but she was all smiles for the regulars at the bar. In a nutshell the food was really good but the service was not.

"I absolute was disgusted with the behavior I received in this place. While placing the food, the lady when I kindly asked her to change the container, then with that everything was done with attitude. They had called me crazy after I lost my appetite after their disrespect. An employee in a legal place to serve the public should be able to enter without any rude  comments making this place absolutely horrible.

I mean this do not go to this place, I‚Äôm a college student and majoring in criminal justice, every place has regulations or orders, and I can understand if you are having a horrible day, and your attitude is spiking but almost throwing my food out of spite and attitude is unacceptable and repulsive when an individual has done nothing to create a hostile environment. Under the court of law, discriminating for age, class, gender or even mental health issues saying that ‚Äúshe is crazy‚Äù and laughing after that during clock hours is horrific.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cUttWi1BRRAB,New York,en

I had ordered my steak rare and it was over cooked and not flavorful the peppercorn sauce was the bigger let down. As for the service horrible. We had to flag down our waitress multiple times to place our order and get our bill never bothered once to check in on how the meal was.  Only reason our drinks were refilled were because the bussers would be the ones to come over.

"If you‚Äôre going to be a steak you must know how to cook steak! And this place unfortunately does not.  We ordered a Ny strip steak (medium) with mac cheese & truffle fires and a beef bourguignon. The steak was overcooked to well done and had no flavor, the mac was bland and they forgot the truffle fries even after the food came and we reminded them. As for the beef bourguignon the meat was tender and flavorful but it did not pair well with the pasta they serve it with. Although we did not enjoy the dinner we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers. We had the caesar salad, bacon & french onion soup, I love me some french onion soup and this one was good and their frida cocktail was delicious.

OK y'all this ones gonna be a long one. I am so so happy I found this lil hidden in plain sight gem! We went for bae's birthday and let me tell you this place did not disappoint! From when we walked in we were amazed at the instant vibe. It's a wonderful size restaurant and beautifully decorated. There were a few people but it was fairly empty and our waitress told us we could pick our own seats. We opted to sit as close to the fireplace area as possible. I mentioned to our wonderful waitress that it was bae's birthday and she smiled and winked at me. From beginning to end our waitress was perfect! She showed the right amount of attention to us without being overbearing and annoying. She took her time explaining the menu and drink menu. (We're always looking for the strongest drinks on the menu lol)The menu has something wonderful for every one's price range. I went with the lamb chops and brussel sprouts(y'all know how much I love the sprouts) bae went with the salmon and veggies with mashed potatoes. While waiting for our food the bartender came over with complimentary glasses of Rose(idk if they do that all the time so don't go there expecting it and being mad at me if they don't lol) and it was dry and delicious we were pleasantly shocked lol. Then the food came and everything was perfectly seasoned and phenomenal! They really show you love and take care of you in there! They have happy hour from 4-7 so needless to say we will def be checking that out very soon! While we were sitting and talking the waitress came by and asked if we wanted to take pictures by the piano(insert happy face) she even remembered it was his bday and brought him a complimentary piece of cheesecake which was also delish and sang him happy birthday all by herself. This place is a ten out of ten! Run don't walk to Home BX Steakhouse!,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMGJpdFZBEAE,New York,en

The restaruant is a great time. They have a really nice vibe and it‚Äôs a family friendly place. I‚Äôve been several times with my Duaghter for daddy Duaghter dates and they never let us down. The burgers they have are really good. Be prepared to make a mess due to the cheese suace they have on it. The mess takes nothing away from the flavor. The waiters are very nice and professional. The bar scene also looks like a great time. The music isn‚Äôt to loud for you to hear your company and they told us that someone plays the piano live on Wednesday nights.

So I ordered 1 French Toast Special (Scrambled Eggs, Bacon and Home Fries) and 1 Orange Juice. I ate breakfast for dinner comfortably in peace while watching television, something I haven‚Äôt done since the start of the digital age three years ago. It is wonderful how people can find new ways to connect by searching for opportunities online. I enjoyed the service, from the waiter serving me very friendly to the compassionate clerk by the entrance of the restaurant. I was about to take the glass with me by accident, but at least I was able to get the energy to go home.

On another evening, I stopped by to get the soup of the day. The waitress mentioned clam chowder, so I immediately ordered for the night. It was delicious. Good for the soul in the early winter days of the new year.

We had the avocado nachos salad that was made on siteü§î, The enchiladas and steak was very good and the drinks frozen 2 margaritas mango & strawberry ü•∞ü™Ö, a small bottle of coke and 1 mojito ü§´ were definitely good, my little boy had apple juice with a small side other so for 3 adults and one child the bill was over $200+ 

I was a little surprised but again for the first time being in this restaurant and the area it wasn't bad except the over price $$$.

I would visit again if the price is rightü§´ü§î just make sure you know what your ordering and the drinks, I been to other (Latin American) &  Mexican restaurants like in upper Manhattan and the prices are reasonable, the amount of food very satisfying , in other words I can feed 3people + 1 child comfortably with the same type of menu without breaking the bank.

On the whole, my meal was edible yet underwhelming. My friend ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki with fried rice and two spring rolls. He loves teriyaki but  he's not a fan of their chicken and beef teriyaki. Being first-time patrons of The Yummy Kitchen, we felt blind-sided when the lady on the phone told me AFTER taking our food order that for FIRST-TIME customers they only accept cash or Apple Pay. This was not stated nor specified on their handout menu. On The Yummy Kitchen handout menu we'd received, it listed the credit cards that The Yummy Kitchen accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Discover. We were ready to pay for our meal with a credit card when the lady surprised me with the 'first-time customer/ cash/Apple Pay payment requirement'. We felt that was misleading and not in good faith.

When we asked if we could sit on a particular 4-seat table), we were told no because the restaurant may get busy later.

However, the woman behind the counter decided that it was a very good idea to only send me a portion of white rice and the dessert, without telling me she canceled the item on line. So I called very upset to ask why they didn't call me to let me know, maybe I‚Äôd have can change the main course, because logically I was waiting for it, to which she cheekily and sarcastically said: yes my love, I should have called you, but I didn't, I'm sorry, and we closed, we don‚Äôt have more delivery service for today. ü§¨ The order was $30 so I added $6 tip, but when they canceled the item, the order price changed to $10 but the tip continued being $6 still, that means I payed more than 50% tip and all because of this woman's ‚Äúaudacity‚Äù. could you imagine how annoying this would be if your bill has some zeros more?

"I have visited this business since my childhood. My uncles, parents, and all my relatives used to eat here after work or on their days off, either dining in or taking food home. We never had issues. The women working at the counter were always friendly, always smiling. The same when paying at the cash register. But I don't know, in recent years, they have changed ownership, I suppose, and the staff as well, leading to a drastic change. The people there, especially those working at the front, always seem busy. That's not the problem. The issue is their attitude. They look at you with complete disdain if you're not from their country. And even though I'm of a white complexion, it's not that big of a deal, but just for not being Dominican, I would say, they have a very arrogant attitude. And if one complains to the person at the cash register, total support, I think they cover for each other. The customer service is terrible, terrible, terrible. How do they expect someone to give them a tip with such an attitude? And they don't just expect it, they demand it, that's the worst part. I'm giving it one star because that's what it asks for, but honestly, this business doesn't even deserve one star. Moreover, people are even drinking at the counter. That never happened before. This business is going to fall soon. I'm warning my family and friends not to go to this place because the people are rude. Lately, I've noticed that the food is coming out disgusting. Zero, zero stars, I would say for this restaurant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MWVqcUNBEAE,New York,en

"The service is decent and the space clean.  The music is a little loud, I couldn't imagine wanting to sit here and chat on a date.  I guess that's why the place isn't too packed on a sunny afternoon.
Anyhow on to the important part: the food.

The burgers are overcooked to well done, greasy, and flavorless! If they're seasoned, I couldn't tell- they were so bland. And the tots were too crispy and oily. I attached a photo of the oil left behind. The bottom is where the tots were.  At the end I was left with an oily after taste, and a slight allergic reaction- I think the burger had mayo, which I don't eat often.  But I had mayo last week, and didn't have the same reaction.
If you want an over-priced greasy burger- still don't come here.  You can get a better overpriced burger someplace else.

I should also add that someone let their half-eaten burger behind on another table- which I wish I saw before ordering.  It looked like a heap of uninspired disappointment in a bun.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeXZTX2h3RRAB,New York,en

Food, Service and Ambience are always amazing here.
Live music from local artist Thursday to Sunday.

Bartenders usually know what you are drinking when you come back the 3rd time and are always quick to serve, even when there is no space at the bar.

Happy Hours are from open to 7:00PM on weekdays, their sangria, margaritas are strong and on point and come in many fresh fruit flavors.

Some must haves on the tapas are the empanadas, mofonguitos, pulpo, tostones and chorizo, bacon wrapped dates, canastitas de bacalao, for mains the churrasco, paella and salmon are amazing.

"The service here is top notch. My wife and I sat at the bar. We weren't that hungry so the portions here were perfect and I was way more interested in the bar. We sat at the bar and our servers were very gracious. They created a mezcal flight for me based on my little knowledge of mezcal, my alcoholic preferences, and what dishes we ordered. $48 for a mezcal flight, 3 servings from 3 different bottles. Each one was very different from the last. My wife had a non alcoholic drink, La Orgua. I took a sip. It was a very mild flavored drink. Looked beautiful but tasted watered down. We ordered the guacamole which came from cotija cheese on top. The guac serving was generous and delicious. The aguachiles were Oaxacan style. I've had aguachiles in Mexico City so I was foolishly expecting a different flavor so I did not enjoy that much. Nothing wrong with the dish but I felt the seasoning was lacking. Still a generous portion. Both dishes served with tostadas. I'll definitely be back for mezcal and to try cocktails.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeHJfZ2h3RRAB,New York,en

"I feel taken advantage of, robbed even.

My friend and I went to Tobal√° to have the Valentine prefixe menu. We reserved our table via Resy, and paid a non-refundable deposit of $50 EACH, which they stated would go towards the overall tab at the end of the night.

Our reservation was for 7pm, yet we were seated at a bit after 7:30pm, and did not receive our first course until 8:30. The wait time in-between courses was ridiculous and every dish was more mediocre than the last. The staff was pretty nice whenever they stopped by our table, but that was a rare occurrence in itself.

When it was time to pay, they did not include the $100 we had already put towards the bill until we informed them. And when asked to split the bill in half between two cards, they ended up putting 1/3 on one card and 2/3 of the bill on the other.

I would not come back, and definitely not recommend. I was looking forward to visiting this new addition to the Riverdale area, and really sad that this was the experience we got. Truly baffled.

"My recent experience at Lemonade Restaurant left much to be desired, and various factors contributed to an overall lackluster visit. The food, including the chicken breast and salmon dishes, fell short of expectations, with a notable lack of flavor and a disappointingly dry texture. It was evident that the kitchen may have overlooked crucial elements that elevate a dining experience.

Adding to the disappointment was the sparse crowd; we were the only patrons at 7 pm on a Saturday night. This near-empty atmosphere was further highlighted by the visible departure of several potential diners who seemed unimpressed with the offerings. The lack of a bustling ambiance raised concerns about the restaurant's appeal and left us questioning our choice for the evening.

Unfortunately, the service didn't manage to salvage the experience. The servers appeared disinterested and failed to provide the helpful and attentive service one expects in a dining setting.

On a slightly positive note, the lemonade drinks offered a modest reprieve, providing a decent refreshment. However, they were not enough to counterbalance the subpar food and lackluster service.

In conclusion, Lemonade Restaurant's underwhelming food, poor service, and a conspicuously empty dining area on a Saturday night collectively painted a picture of an establishment struggling to meet expectations.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTdicHBnRRAB,San Francisco,en

"We came around 7:30pm but everything inside already was already cleaned up, with chairs up and floors wet, and all food trays put away. The closing time is supposed to be 9pm. This looks unprofessional to the customers walking in.

The photos and menu looks amazing but the reality is totally different. The guy who works here for sure he is not happy with his job/boss or he is having a bad day. No smile at all the whole time. He made me feel like me eating here is adding more work to his job, especially when he already cleaned up the whole restaurant 1.5 hour before closing time.
Food is served as cold even for meat like salmon/chicken unless you ASK for warm and the way they put the food together on the plate just like throwing everything inside to fill up the plate. You will be surprised by the server handing you the plate by ONE hand like don‚Äôt really care how you feel about their service.
I would give 0 star if I could for the quality of food and 00 for the service.

"February 2024:
Enjoyed a family dinner on a Thursday night. We pre-ordered the chicken stuffed with sticky rice. This dish is quite enjoyable because it's fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice that has a lot of delicious ingredients mixed in. This place did a good job.

Peking Duck was excellent. The skin was very crispy . Fish fillet with asparagus was a Big hit too. Simple and cooked perfectly.

The white chicken with ginger sauce was another good dish.

Everything was tasty . We ordered the pork belly taro clay pot dish that is an old time favorite and hard to find nowadays. Everyone enjoyed that too.

Obviously the most basic menu item, but the burger really left a lot to be desired, the meat tasted bland, dry, and overcooked, and the massive dry bun did it no favors. Hopefully the more complex menu items are better, because this was underwhelming for sure.

The salad bar ended up being pretty overpriced, I wanted to try their various pasta salads but with the weight price it ended up being $9 for a pretty small amount of food. I‚Äôm assuming this price is meant for customers to take the hot protein items like chicken tenders rather than just salads, but I found it too expensive.

Also there was no napkins available at the self service area for utensils as far as I could tell and that was awkward.

"Reasonably priced self-serve food bar and made-to-order menu items.

This restaurant in the Cesar Chavez Student Center at SFSU has a large selection of sandwiches and egg dishes, as well as a self-serve food bar. The made-to-order items usually take five to ten minutes. However, a broccoli and cheese baked potato I ordered took twelve minutes, but it was a big spud. The prices for the self-service food bar are calculated by weight (currently $9.75/lb), so you can have as much or as little of the food you want and pay proportionally. They have shrimp, if you're looking to get more value. In my opinion, most of the food is good. I hear their sandwiches are fantastic, so I'll give them a try next time. Service was good.

I have never gotten so much meat in ramen, the noodle were perfect, and the flavors were amazing. The tempura was very fresh and delish too.

I went on a weekday night, so only 1 other table was there, so the food came out very quickly. The restaurant itself looks like its a bit older, but it doesn't matter since the food is so good.

"Great no frills steak house in the neighborhood.

Very simple but to the point menu.

Asked for a very rare steak, came through and was well seasoned and of good quality.

2 steak meals with beer is $60, which is a great value!

Interior design is humble and welcoming. Feels like you are transported to a movie set in the early 70s or 80s.

My only notes: drafts appear to be misaligned. Beer tasted a little flat.

I look at the menu on the wall and went for the French Burger, the order included a green salad and my choice of baked potato or rice pilaf. The burger was cooked fresh to order and while my order was being prepared I started with the salad, fresh iceberg lettuce, sliced carrots, red onions, peppers, tomatoes and ranch dressing, the French Burger came soon after, the plate was served by the Chef, a rectangular large bun that was soft and expertly toasted on the grill, usual burger setup, and the baked potato was split in half with melted butter on top. I was happy with the quality of the ingredients definitely a bargain for $13.99. The restaurant specializes on steaks, kabobs and bbq chicken.

I mentioned we were there for a couple of slices to which he replied (cutting me off) ""Only whole pies if dining in."" The way he said it though...there was a guy tossing pizza dough standing behind him who just creepily stared at us. They both looked at us like we were some type of stain they both didn't want to bother with. I wouldn't ve had a problem ordering a whole pizza and taking the rest home had he said it in a nicer manner. We thanked him and left in awe.

So filling! Also the order comes out pretty quickly. I have not called in yet but it only takes about 10 to 15 minutes for them to fix up your order. There is indoor seating but I haven't seen too many people sit inside, I imagine they have more takeout than anything.

Did you not serve alcohol like most Chinese eateries. I only included this because I overheard a patron asking if there was beer.

If you are in the area stop by and try it out! It isn't bougie. I would say it's not too healthy but oh so delicious.

"We came here for breakfast on Saturday morning and this place was pretty packed but no waiting as it was a largely spaced restaurants.  I liked that most customers appeared local and groups of families. We ordered Irish breakfast, breakfast specials and waffles.  Irish breakfast was pretty good which had Irish bangers and other types of sausages that tasted like blood sausage .   The hash browned seemed a little undercooked.  Overall I felt that their savory breakfast was decent but the sweet breakfast such as pancakes and waffle were just ok .  They were mostly dry and floury , even adding syrup didn‚Äôt make it better.

The traffic wasn't bad but this place is located near the industrial area of the Port of Seattle so there's some big trucks in the morning.

"While the staff at this establishment continue to provide excellent service and food quality, I must mention the deplorable behavior of owner Ericka Burke. Never before have I witnessed such callous, selfish, and reckless actions. When a neighborhood plumbing renovation brought raw sewage water into the restaurant's pipes, Miss Burke demanded to keep the restaurant open even after her staff closed for the day in order to protect customers from serious illness. The implications of her irresponsible wishes in this situation are staggering. This woman should not be allowed to serve food to the public, since she is clearly more concerned with making money than with providing her customers safe food.

Perhaps more repugnant even than allowing raw sewage into her food, is the manner in which Miss Burke treats her staff. I have frequently seen her yell at her serving and cook staff in front of customers, even using profanities with children in the restaurant. In spite of her ridiculously unprofessional behavior, Volunteer Park Cafe's competant staff remains loyal to the local customers who have come to love VPC's family-friendly atmosphere, which is strongly bolstered by baker and co-owner Heather Earnhardt. It is clear to all who visit this restaurant that it is only Heather's efforts and constant presence that keep VPC running smoothly.

Ericka Burke should be ashamed of herself. She obviously wants only to make a name for herself by stepping on the backs of the people below her. Bouncing checks to her food purveyors, failing to pay her employees on time if at all, and providing false information to unemployment services are among some of her frequent improprieties.

I can only trust that some day, her wickedness will come back ten-fold, as it so often does with people as self-serving, greedy, and malicious as this woman.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROWNQck5BEAE,Seattle,en
"The food at Cafe Flora tastes about okay and that's just my personal preference. The one thing I liked is their high tea offering last year as it had a vegan option. I'd have given them 4 stars but I don't find their customer experience great hence the 2 stars.

The staff at the restaurant and the team managing their Instagram account don't seem like the kindest people out there hence I'd consider going to another restaurant instead of coming here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkcmZybWx3RRAB,Seattle,en

"I visited Cafe Flora based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation, and it surpassed expectations. I love trying quirky/creative vegetarian and vegan restaurants, and this one definitely fit the bill!

We called ahead (30 min) since we were a larger party of 8, and they had the table ready when we got there, even though they don‚Äôt take reservations. The table location wasn‚Äôt ideal since it was by the door to their outdoor seating area and there was a frequent cold breeze, but thoughtful nonetheless. Our waiter was super friendly, which made our experience even more memorable.

We ordered nearly the entire menu and shared everything family style. My favorites were the brussel sprouts, coconut tofu lettuce wraps, eggplant & bell pepper campanelle, and turkish cauliflower polenta. The flavor profile for each of these was pretty complex and balanced.

A few of us got drinks - the mulled wine, wakey wakey, and rosemary lemon drop - which were all pretty delicious and strong. We ended the night with dessert, which were yummy but not neccesarily something to write home about.

Overall, it was a memorable experience and I‚Äôd definitely return if I‚Äôm in the area again! Easily on my top 10 restaurant list.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbllETmJnEAE,Seattle,en
"Cafe Flora is an institution in Seattle.  One of the first major vegetrian restaurants in the city.  But it has outgrown its pioneering reputation as it has expanded its footprint with a new restaurant and bakery in SeaTac.

Our party of five waited 20 minutes for a table.  Then we waited another 30 minutes before anyone took our order, then once we gave the order we waited another 20 minutes for our food.  Meanwhile our teenage daughter was desperately hungry. When my wife went to the wait staff inquiring when our food would be staff, a waitress said she would ""check.""

Once the food arrived it was ordinary.  Well and beautifully plated.  But it was generally bland and boring.

I don't blame the wait staff.  Clearly management of the restaurant has left it understaffed.  Our waitress was taking care of 15 tables in our room and disappeared for long periods. Perhaps serving even more tables elsewhere.  A totally unpleasant experience.  Oh and did I say it was my wife's birthday??  What a downer.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPXzhURFJREAE,Seattle,en
"Going to Cafe Flora used to be my favorite part of being in Seattle. I was glad that they had kept their mouthwatering coconut cake as they continued to innovate, but over the years it went from being a soft cake with tons of coconut in it and subtle undertones of intricate flavors, to being a super dry cake that's overly sweet and just tastes like frosting. It seems that they've changed recipes, or simply stopped putting in the work that they used to. The restaurant is too expensive for what it is now. Their burger also used to be better, I still love the fries though. They don't have enough vegan options considering what is now doable with vegan food. 20 years ago they were surely the best vegetarian restaurant in Seattle, but they need to catch up now. It was a dollar to add vegan mozzarella to the burger, and it tasted like Daiya. Dairy cheese was cheaper to add, so they tax vegans here. Even if it wasn't Daiya, it sure did taste the same. I was expecting something unique from somewhere that brands themselves as a tad bit ""finer"" of dining ($$$). Plating is nice. Interior and staff are welcoming",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURveGRMdm9nRRAB,Seattle,en
"I found Cafe Flora on HappyCow, which is an app that helps vegans and vegetarians find restaurant options in their area. I'm glad to say that this place definitely didn't disappoint.

As a vegan it can be super difficult to find good restaurant options so every time I find one I feel like I've struck gold. Even though this place isn't entirely vegan, there are enough options that it'll make most vegans very happy. I ordered the Saffron and Lobster Mushroom Risotto and the Madison cocktail.

The Risotto consisted of arborio rice, saffron, and lobster mushrooms among other ingredients. It didn't taste overly indulgent or heavily sweet or savory, rather it just had a very complimentary combination of flavors and a great texture which didn't warrant extra sugar or salt. I love it when menu items don't taste overly greasy or rich and they have a cleaner vibe about them. The Risotto was accompanied with a minimalist Arugula salad with a great lemon vinaigrette. So simple, yet clean. Good dishes don't need a million ingredients, just a handful of quality ones.

The Madison cocktail seemed like a modified Manhattan, using an earl grey infused vermouth rather than a traditional Italian vermouth in a Manhattan. Honestly, I'm not super educated with my liquors so I cannot speak too much to the complexity of the cocktail, but I can tell you that I really enjoyed it.

I'll definitely be coming back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhXy11STBnRRAB,Seattle,en

"Went back to Cafe Flora for some delicious Brussels Sprouts. They do a great job with social distancing in the restaurant. However, after sitting down for an hour, I was asked to leave because there were other people waiting for a table. After buying a full meal, coffee AND tipping 20% to the servers, I was asked to leave a restaurant because I was lingering. Unacceptable. Most people are not dining out often during Covid. So to be asked to leave a restaurant during your one weekly outing is not a great feeling. I may return for the Brussels Sprouts, but I will get these to go, so I don't have to deal with the terrible customer service.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX1BqV2F3EAE,Seattle,en

"Sunday, August 18, 2019, I took my 2 out of town vegetarian guests to Cafe Flora, which we thought was the best.  First the hostess would not let us sit at the table where there would be no sun in our eyes.  Later the waitress let us move to that table.  One of my guests has food allergies. She ordered a  pizza and made it clear she could not eat onions or she would get ill.  She was half way into the pizza and noticed the onions (hard to notice, so cooked down).  The waitress was very apologetic, said it was a kitchen error, and offered to give a discount on the bill.  The discount was $2!  My guest talked to the manager (who was also the uncooperative hostess) and told her how unsatisfactory a $2 discount was, since she was going to be ill from the pizza. The manager finally took the pizza off the bill.  This would have been done automatically at any other restaurant.  We're not going back there.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVXzh2M0hnEAE,Seattle,en

My favorite main dish was the Octopus, which was so soft and not rubbery at all! My favorite vegetable dish was the Spinach. The pine nuts and raisins pair so well with the natural bitterness of the spinach. We ordered 2 desserts, both of which were delicious, but if I had to pick just one to recommend, it‚Äôd be the Flan de Cafe.

Cafe review only - The restaurant menu provides many different variations of egg, sausage, vegetable, and potato dishes. We anticipated the quality of the cafe food to be similar to a IHOP, and we found it met that level of American-style breakfast dishes. The welcoming staff were friendly and offered to come find us when a table was ready so that we could peruse the record store in search of artistic gems. The combination of the record store and cafe is an excellent idea, however, a little more attention to the quality of a few select dishes, rather than offering a long listed of similar dishes, would help to elevate the status of the cafe among local foodies.

"Update:
I‚Äôd say quality has gone down in the last two years they roll their injera and don‚Äôt put the platter for on the injera they place everything separate its like they‚Äôve changed for the white population, injera is not the same and shiro quality has went down their portions are small as well. I really like this place as they offer alcohol and live music but I can say it‚Äôs no longer worth the hype. You can see the reviewed pictures of how the platters are placed on different plates when that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs supposed to be served at all

They‚Äôre priced a bit high for a new place, however their food is good, portions are a hit or miss. Sometimes they give you a decent portion other times they hide everything with injera and barely put any sauce in so I suggest checking before you leave. Their injera is good but their teff injera is okay. The restaurants atmosphere seems like they want to make it welcoming to Americans, which is good in Seattle. But their food also does not always seem authentic because of that, like they purposely make it less spicy. But they offer deli every and takeout later than any Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle so just by that they‚Äôre up points. Always friendly though and one of the few Ethiopian sports bars in Seattle that make it seem like they want everyone there (not my atmosphere I prefer Ethiopian/ Eritrean only) but hey in Seattle if you want your business to survive you adapt and I can respect that. I believe their chef is East African although I could not tell, she looked a bit Hispanic but she makes good food I was definitely a bit hesitant when I first went. They‚Äôre not my first choice but if Chefs Cafe or Kezira are closed then I will go here so definitely top 3 for Ethiopian restaurants although unlike Chefs and Kezira they do not offer Ayeb with your platter, not sure if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a veggie platter or what but their ayeb ‚Äúhouse cheese‚Äù is priced pretty high at $3 but they do give you a good amount. If you‚Äôre an American wanting to try a new place that feels welcoming however still cultural, this is your place but if you‚Äôre habesha I suggest ordering to go.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjdlNWJ3EAE,Seattle,en

"The place isn't the most appealing, but their food is great! I have lived in the immediate neighborhood (DC native born and raised otherwise) for about 2.5 years and only started going here last year off of a bartender's recommendation as what he called ""the best fried chicken"" when it came to ordering out. I doubted him, I did.

Now, I won't say it was the BEST, but it certainly was some real good fried chicken. And the pieces were great sizes. I always get dark meat, if that matters. Burgers, onion rings, and their biscuits are fantastic as well. When I did order burgers, always the Mushroom Swiss. But I haven't gotten anything but fried chicken there since last summer, so I can't say much about it today?

I must note, within the past few months, I've noticed their fried chicken is consistently smaller than they used to be. They taste fine still, but due to being significantly smaller, they're not as juicy. I unfortunately don't find it to be as worthwhile for that anymore. Maybe I'll try their burgers again and see if that changed at all.",ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5d1AwRBAB,Washington,en

"Sat down on the patio around 2:20ish. No one came out so I decided to finally go inside. I stood in the bar for a few minutes with no one acknowledging me. I finally interrupted the staff in the kitchen and asked how the seating worked, do i just sit down, do i order inside first, does anyone come outside?

I came here for the Reuben only to have the staff stall till after the kitchen was closed for lunch to then inform me that the Reuben was no longer available and they would not make me one, or any other food till after 3pm, despite showing up at 2:20 before the kitchen closed.

"We initially booked reservations and were confirmed for it. However, when we went, they seated us at the patio saying that we had outdoor dining confirmation and it was freezing cold.  There was no mention of outdoor dining in the confirmation.  They had a fireplace, but it didn't provide heat at all even though we were seated right next to it. They should at least have a couple of heaters outside if they put people outside for dining.  That's what other restaurants do.  They provided blankets, but it wasn't enough as it was super cold. They later seated us by the bar when some of the guests were gone. The service wasn't great as well as they messed up our order, and the little lamps provided outside weren't working.  We had to tell the server a couple of times about it. When we were seated back indoors, the server didn't help us out with carrying our water or food.  However, the guy at the bar was really nice and got our orders right.  He also made sure we were given all of our orders, and he checked on our orders.  All the pointers to him for giving us a good service than our previous server.  The food was okay too.  The sausage, salad, and sauted vegetables were the only good things at the place.  Everything else was okay.  I would definitely suggest checking out the food options beforehand as there are very few options for non-meat eaters.

"TLDR: Busy casual spot, with an Americanized twist to Vietnamese food. Non-Vietnamese waiters do not know their menu. Food is edible.

I came in with a party of 8 Vietnamese some tourists and some local to Virginia. We were greeted promptly and politely from the waitress. Since there were 8 of us, a lot of menu items were ordered, which included egg rolls, spring rolls, rice, pho, and a vegetarian dish. The menu itself is very beautiful, but the actual food definitely looks nothing like what is pictured.

The service:
Our waitress was very nice, took our order, and repeated it to us. The appetizers came out within 10 minutes, but the main entrees came out, no exaggeration, 45 minutes later. I asked for extra beansprouts, as the existing amount they gave was enough for ants, and later on found out that they gave the entire table extra and charged for it. This would have been nice to know beforehand that this would be extra, which definitely was not the case. We also ordered a banh mi, but after over an hour, we told them not to bring it, as it was taking too long. Our drinks were full, but had to politely ask them for it.

The food:
The food all came out at sporadic times, with the children's food coming out 1 hour after the appetizers, again, no exaggeration. Given the restaurant's name, half of the table decided to order pho, and our waitress got it all wrong. We ordered the ""Pho Tai Nam"" and got the ""Pho Tai Lan"" My table being Vietnamese, pronouncing it correctly, thought that this non-Vietnamese waitress was pronouncing it incorrectly but giving us the correct order. Upon the first 2-3 bites, we were certain that we did not order this entr√©e, and asked the waitress and manager what this was? They kept repeating ""Pho Tai Lan"" and we were like this does not seem right. Anyways, I found a menu on another table that hadn't been pre-bussed in about an hour, and went through it. Saw that they had both a ""Pho Tai Nam"" and a ""Pho Tai Lan"" (For the record, there is no such thing as ""Pho Tai Lan"" so be aware that this proprietary to the restaurant. This is essentially beef pho with the beef being stir-fried with garlic and topped on the pho. sounds good but the beef was over-cooked and tough)
Message to the non-Vietnamese waitress: Please double check with your Vietnamese patrons on their Vietnamese order using your menu.

Management:
Management was a Vietnamese kid who spoke very softly and decided to give us 50% off of two bowls of pho (there were 4 total on our table), which was nice. We spoke to him in Vietnamese throughout our time in the restaurant to get things sorted out, but he was so timid and not confident in his communication. Not much got resolved.

Conclusion:
This restaurant is definitely catered more to Americans who would like to get a basic feel on what Vietnamese food is. The food is mediocre, at best, but maybe this restaurant is catering to the area. Pho Viet USA is a casual spot, with a fancy menu, and a poor food presentation. The prices are high, a little too high, given the food presentation, taste, service, and restaurant ambiance. Would I go back? No. Would I suggest this to an American? Yes. Vietnamese? No.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREem9uQzZBRRAB,Washington,en

Best bbq in the DMV (and maybe Richmond too).  The new summer menu is so fun and delicious. I had the deviled egg salad sandwich and it was a perfect size. Also had the fried pickles and they were the best I've ever had. Usually fried pickles are too greasy or wet but these were amazing. And the sauce served with it was such a good complement.

"Tell me where you can go to get outstanding BBQ, buy allocated bourbon by the bottle, watch games, smoke cigars on the patio on Saturday nights, and join their Wednesday whisky club? Our first visit to Cinder was a great experience. The owner and staff were welcoming. The Old Fashioned is reasonably priced and they use Sazerac. If you want a bottle of some great bourbons, look no further. As long as you buy some food, you're good to go. If you like pork rinds. Then you can't miss these... If you don't like them, then you have to order them just to listen to them keep popping at the table for 5 minutes after they are served. Sunday means brisket day. Chopped, sliced, platter or sandwich, or even by the pound. Pulled pork was outstanding. The 12 yr old loved the Mac n Cheese, we loved the collards, and the sauces were great depending on your taste. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample of all of them. Also, on Wed nights, they have a whiskey club night that is something you need to actually be a member of.

It was a table of two and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt full but it took 30 minutes for the mimosas, another 20 minutes for them to find clean glasses for us to use (the first 4 they were bringing out dirty !!! ). Let‚Äôs not even discuss how long it took them to make chicken and waffles and an omelette!

The chicken is cooked is sazon and not hard so the chicken was rubbery and could still taste the flour and would leave yellow stains on your fingertips. This made it inedible. Only positive was the salmon omelette.

Lastly, a 20% service fee is added to the bill (this is your servers tip), this could explain the lack of attentiveness from the waiters or waitresses because the fee is not an option.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNmQyLXp3RRAB,Washington,en

"Solid Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas topped with a variety of fresh ingredients and perfect for a relatively tasty, quick, and affordable meal. The concept is pretty similar to CAVA -- you can either build your own by choosing a base, main, and toppings, or you can pick from one of their chef-curated options. I usually opt to build my own with their salmon fillet or roasted butternut squash over kale, and topped with all the veggies and hummus. All of their veggies are super fresh, and their sauces all pack a ton of flavor (watch out for the spicy ones -- they actually are quite spicy). Their salmon fillets tend to be very small and a touch dry, as I assume they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, but they still pack a good flavor.

Although the food is solid, it's generally not my first choice for fast-casual Mediterranean fare, as (1) they're not always aware of which allergens are in their food, and (2) despite being a fast-casual spot, service can often be quite delayed.

Starting with the first -- the staff is wonderful at handling dietary restrictions; they'll put on new gloves, make sure your order is on a clean service (i.e., new foil or bowl), and avoid working on other orders at the same time as yours. However, I'm worried they haven't been told what all the allergens are in all of their ingredients. For example, I've received their gluten-free falafel pita box at several catered office lunches, and, unfortunately, ended up feeling pretty sick afterwards. Although I appreciate that they have a gluten-free pita (although it does taste pretty dismal) and that they have gluten-free options for desserts and sides, I don't believe their falafel is gluten-free (or maybe it's something in the rice or one of the toppings...I'm not entirely sure what it is or if there's just some cross-contamination, but something in those boxes definitely isn't sitting right with me).

Beyond dietary restrictions, the only other drawback to Roti is that it's not always as speedy as advertised, which is not at all the fault of the employees. Every time I go in, there are usually only 1-2 people working the entire restaurant, fielding a slew of both in-person and mobile orders. This naturally creates a delay in getting out all orders; for example, I'll sometimes wait upwards of 30+ min. for a line of five or so in-person customers because the staff is so swamped with mobile orders. On the flip side, if you get a mobile order, definitely go to pick it up instead of using their delivery service (which includes third-party apps like UberEats, as Roti opts to use their own drivers for those services). I usually have to wait over 45 min. for a delivery order, despite the quoted wait time of 15 min. and that my apartment is less than 2 miles away from the restaurant.

All in all, I think Roti is a solid place for fresh, flavor-packed Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas. However, I would recommend caution if you have dietary restrictions or if you're in a huge rush.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkczdhbmFnEAE,Washington,en

They took the extra time and care to make sure the food we ordered was fresh and not whatever was left out during the day.   I wish we had one of these places back home in Boston.   Allthough think of it as a chipolte but with a Mediterranean/middle eastern twist. The Google photos are misleading.

It definitely tasted like eating at your grandmothers. The potato salad was just like my Gma‚Äôs; finely diced with celery, celery seed, and a slight tang of mustard accompanied by a slight sweetness.  The collards are vegan hence no meat but were still delicious, tender, and flavorful. The drinks were delicious as well. The portion sizes were quite large with everyone having leftovers except for the lamb chops they were so delicious that my friend ate all of them.

Food is what you would expect from a Subway, double chocolate cookies 10/10. The bottled drinks aren't cold very, so you may need to chill them or add ice. I think it's just their mini fridge.

"Nestled in the heart of Petworth on Upshur, San Matteo, is a delightful Italian restaurant that exceeded all expectations. The wife and I have walked by here for a while and finally found time to do an impromptu date night. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy atmosphere that set the stage for a memorable dining experience. The attentive wait staff made us feel right at home, offering recommendations and ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt the waitress‚Äôs name, but she was so nice!

The menu boasted a variety of classic Italian dishes, and we opted for the funghi pasta and bolognese, both of which were bursting with flavor and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The house red wine complemented our meal beautifully, and we couldn't resist indulging in the decadent tiramisu for dessert. I do have to warn you‚Ä¶their bread is dangerous. It‚Äôs so addictive and fluffy. I couldn‚Äôt stop eating it.

San Matteo is a must-visit for anyone craving some great Italian food in a cozy local family vibe. We really hope they take off and more people frequent this spot.

"If you have a nut or tree nut allergy, you have to go into the store personally and request to ask for the nutritional information book (if they even know where or what that is). Overall, they don‚Äôt instill a lot of confidence and here is why:
I called the restaurant to ask if they had an online list of allergens (they said they don‚Äôt) before I placed an order online or if they had an online link they could point me to since I didn‚Äôt trust any of the ones I found online were the official US Nando‚Äôs ones. On their website FAQs if you click on ‚ÄúCan I see your nutritional information?‚Äù it just takes you to the online menu.

"Never been disappointed as I am today, been coming here for 5 years to support this business because I genuinely enjoyed the food. Today that changed when a new young staff served me what seems to be left over pieces of shredded  chicken. I ordered the brown stew chicken with rice and peas and cabbage. As the server was making my large plate I asked her not to give me broken pieces. She gave me two small portions of whole chicken and the rest of it was broken shredded chicken which amounted to one extra piece of it had not been broken, so I paid for three pieces of chicken for what should have been a large which usually includes about 5 good pieces. Then she literally gave me one scoop of cabbage that were over cooked and needless to say I‚Äôm highly disappointed for her service. The owner was there but she is not approachable as she never smiles and always seems to just want to get people in and out her business. I think I will no longer support places like this although in the past I have enjoyed their food today was just trash of food service and poor quality of food.

Ordered the spicy wings with the sauce on the side and the smell of the chicken by itself wasn't to pleasing and was completely unseasoned. However, it does pair well with the sauce once accompanied.

Ordered the shrimp and chicken fried rice also which was good. Note it is not Chinese fried rice so you won't get all the components such as mung bean sprouts and the rice is different. However, I was really impressed with the taste and freshness of this dish. I was looking for the best fried rice in DC and some of the reviews stated this was the place.

"Today, we were incredibly fortunate to visit a unique restaurant, Monocle, located on Capitol Hill. We initially chose it due to its proximity to our hotel, but it turned out to be a true ""Washingtonian gem."" Opened in 1960, this restaurant has been operated by the same family ever since. The menu is concise, which we believe highlights the culinary excellence presented in merely five dishes. We were in search of ""authentic American steaks from real American beef from real American cows."" What we received far exceeded our expectations. Both steaks we ordered were exquisitely prepared to perfection. We both agreed that these were the best steaks we've ever had the pleasure of eating in our lives. #Masterpiece

As if the meal itself wasn't enough, our server, Marinos Apostolopoulos, provided us with a genuine journey through the history of this establishment. We are deeply grateful!

Given its location near the Capitol, the restaurant has been visited by at least half of American politicians over the last 60 years, including Presidents Nixon, Kennedy, Bush, and Clinton. Celebrities like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, among other incredible individuals, have also frequented this place. The number of VIPs and their dedications displayed in their own photos hanging on every wall is truly astonishing.

One of the servers celebrated his 50th work anniversary here two months ago with a surprise party for 250 people, an event that was featured on the front page of the Washington Post, which we had the opportunity to read.

The place is beautiful, with incredibly friendly service and excellent food. The wonderful experiences we had will stay with us forever. It's worth traveling for moments like these.

We highly recommend it and would love to return someday.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbHVxaU5BEAE,Washington,en
I would say this restaurant was spectacular in the past.  Now it has wait staff that are tired of loud tourists that dress in sweats and wear caps during dinner and laugh far too loud and only leave the Midwest every 5 years for a vacation.  The service was what I would call angry and when someone rips the menu out of your hand and is rude you know you are in for a ride.  After 15 min of not being served and threatening to leave you get service‚Ä¶.well.  The food was good but I wonder why restaurants feel that everything needs spice.  Bisque was far too salty and too much chili for the crab.  Steak was good because we said don‚Äôt season it we will do it ourselves.  The building is old and interesting  but if you are a tourist go there if you are not a tourist and more discriminating you would know better not to go here for dinner anyway,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENnFiTjF3RRAB,Washington,en

"I honestly cannot believe this place only has 4.2 stars (at time of review). Literally everything we ordered, which was almost everything, was amazing. The kale salad (can‚Äôt remember exactly the name) might have been the best thing on the menu, which is remarkable for a fried chicken restaurant. The ordering and payment system was convenient and everything came really quickly. The atmosphere inside is kind of like a retro diner",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbWRUdGl3RRAB,Washington,en

The food wasn't hot just like any other chicken place where they make chicken it sits until the chicken is sold they charge you for your dipping sauce & the cilantro lime slaw didn't really wow me it lacked flavor.

"Worse dining experience of my life. Definitely-  if I could. Service was bad, restroom was bad, & the food was so horrible I was sick immediately after eating just a few bites!! I‚Äôd rather burn my $100+ spent there than eat there again. 1st time visiting  New Orleans & this experience completely ruined it for me & my family. We walked in & the vibe wasn‚Äôt friendly at all. I should have known to trust my gut feeling. The server coldly handed us menus & left. I was debating if we should leave cuz he didn‚Äôt come back for like 15mins, but I wanted to give him another chance. He quickly took our orders & left with a cold expression. My son ordered dirty rice & he said we don‚Äôt have that. So I‚Äôm like ok maybe he‚Äôs having a bad day it‚Äôs whatever. Wrong!! While waiting for our food, I went to use the restroom. Doors were broken for both stalls. Toilet paper roll on the ground & one didn‚Äôt even have toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. It was so sketchy, I decided to hold myself until we got to another bathroom. When we finally got our food it didn‚Äôt look bad but after tasting the food I felt sick right away. And wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just me. But nope!! Tried the jambalaya rice & it tasted like sour partially uncooked rice. Horrible!! Took a few bites of my seafood boiled. The potato & corn textured seemed ok but the flavor was very strange. You‚Äôd think since Louisiana is know for their seafood boils it‚Äôll be at least edible. I don‚Äôt know what seasoning they put in their seafood boiled, but ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. I ate one shrimp & it tasted like I was eating raw stanky fish. I had a few other people tried it & said it was bad too. I immediately decided we shouldn‚Äôt eat anymore of our food. I didn‚Äôt don‚Äôt want us to get food poisoning since we were on a road trip & had many stops to go yet. Our bill was $100+ for the most nastiest food ever. My husband was so kind he still left a tip despite how horrible everything was. I literally was trying hard not to vomit as we were walking out of the restaurant. I barely made it out before vomiting outside & on the way to the public restroom a few blocks away. It was so bad I couldn‚Äôt get rid of that nasty taste in my mouth. I drank half a bottle of coke & ate ice cream to cleanse my palate. Finally stopped my urges to vomit. My hands stank like raw fish even after washing my hands 20 times at 5 different bathrooms. I have never left a online review for a restaurant before, but I want to warn people about how horrible this experience was.

Not worth the hype. Crawfish etoufee was meh--bland seasoning and chewy crawfish. Shrimp creole was meh---bland seasoning and the Shrimp did not taste fresh at all. There was a distinct previously frozen taste. Jambalaya was very very dry and the sausage was burned.
Felt rushed by the waiter. Fumes from the seafood seasoning permeated the restaurant unlike any other restaurant I've been to before and made us sneeze frequently and made our eyes water.

If you want good food there are so many places outside of the French quarter go to magazine street go to city center go to garden district anywhere but the French quarter right now.....This was my first review after leaving that evening and being told R meal was going to get charged correctly.....Food was ok per french quarter standards and have us wrong bill and the run around when they took another card for our meal, not ok.

They have the audacity to charge $18/lb for crawfish after prices everywhere else dropped to $6/lb.

Despite my paltry budget (much less than she normally agrees to rent the space for); an insanely complicated plan for a proposal (I had to lead my girlfriend in through a side entrance that she‚Äôd not recognize, then ask Ms. Novak to herd in in 30 guests to the front room within a 5-minute window before bringing my fianc√©e out to propose to her on the balcony where Ms. Novak had provided a perfect ‚Äúhiding spot‚Äù under a tablecloth for my friend to photograph the proposal, after which I brought her down the courtyard steps where she coordinated the timing of my friend‚Äôs dad‚Äôs trumpet-playing); an ever-changing number of guests and menu items (from 12 to 35 and then back down to an eventual 30); and two highly-invested mothers participating in the surprise, Ms. Novak graciously and seamlessly pulled off an engagement event that most people that I was crazy for even attempting.

Ms. Novak spent weeks working with me and my friends and family to ensure that everything went right in this multi-layered plan that likely would take the award for ‚Äúvenue‚Äôs worst nightmare event‚Äù ‚Äì from coordinating walk-throughs in the week leading up to the event, to actually playing a part in the surprise herself (she went so far as to make fake signage and decorations for another ‚Äúevent‚Äù that was to take place that night; and put her acting skills to work to make my charade more believable), she was beyond incredible. All of my guests asked whether she was a wedding coordinator that we could hire, given her flawless facilitation of the entire evening ‚Äì if only she were available to handle my wedding! Needless to say, my fianc√©e was thrilled and said yes. We now hope to plan an engagement party or wedding event at the Swoop-Duggins House next year.

As for the venue itself, Ms. Novak has done an impeccable job of decorating the space down to the very last detail ‚Äì it is New Orleans through and through, and captures the essence of the Crescent City through its d√©cor and ambiance. Cocktails and appetizers were of course fabulous, as well. No way to go wrong with this venue and Ms. Novak. Thank you.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaEtYWFB3EAE,New Orleans,en

"We live near by this restaurant and decided to have a dinner.
We travel and eat out lots. Also being a Hindu vegetarian can write lots about this place.
This restaurant had many new dishes which we don‚Äôt find in other Indian restaurants in NOLA.
It took real long for our order and the portions were very small. The menu is glorified and all necessary accomplishments not served with appetizers or meals.
We order the Paruppu wada for $10. Two small pieces of hard wada served without any chutney. Please don‚Äôt order this appetizer as it was too dry and no taste at all.
We also ordered the Gobi Manchurian was tiny portion and dry without main ingredients like garlic.
The main reason of our visit was to try the Gutti Vankaya, a fancy name for the eggplant curry.
The peanut based curry was great but eggplants were not cooked to the perfection. Literally we ate curry sauce with rice.
This restaurant is located in the CBD and great for the tourists who don‚Äôt care about their money.

Main issue was the rude waitress. We didn‚Äôt want to judge for no reason, but this lady was just rude. She rolled her eyes at customers, and did not answer to our complaints (she said just leave a bad review).

"Poor service and rude owner..

When my group arrived here I opened the front door without stepping in in order to ask if we could be seated outside.  The host rudely yelled at me to put a mask on. My intention was to sit outside to avoid digging out a mask but rather then simply tell me I could go ahead and have a seat the host wouldn't answer me until I put one on. He then told me I could sit at 2 tables. Half of my group was already there and we took a seat at one table.  The server walked by our table twice but did not greet us. The rest of my group arrived and took a seat at the other table.  They had a separate server that brought them water immediately.  My table continued to wait so I went to ask if we had a server coming.  A server told me he would be right with us. I apologized but told him my boyfriend needed to get to the airport soon.  He brought waters to our table.  At that time he took our food and drink order. The second table had their food order taken about 5 minutes after us. All of their food came out more than 10 minutes before ours. After waiting a total of 45 minutes after giving our order my boyfriend went in to ask them to box our food and pay the bill as we no longer had time to eat.  It seemed that the slow service was purposeful as we were overlooked several times.

I was also not impressed with the food.  Small portions and over priced.

Once learning of my poor experience I was contacted by the owner.  Rather then apologize for the bad experience he berated and name called me for writing the review.

After reaching a point of being tired of waiting we decided to leave and head down the road to Baronne Bistro where we had what turned out to be one of the best dinners we've ever had in New Orleans so thank you 8 Block, maybe you can send others to have a wonderful evening as well.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUlUNWNREAE,New Orleans,en

"This is a gorgeous restaurant with a great vibe for an excellent date. The fried sunchoke appetizer was ***heaven***! So many flavors. (really amazingly great. I had a few bites of the gnocchi and it was pillowy, light goodness. Great cocktails--really excellent, and fairly pricey. As a tourist in town we walked there from the French Quarter towards dusk. The neighborhood was so charming, but utterly deserted. Definitely worth the hike, but maybe Uber or Lyft from French Quarter? We were told that to be safe we needed to take a taxi back to the French Quarter.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqM09fcnFBRRAB,New Orleans,en

"With a name like Sneaky Pickle, we thought the menu would be full of pickle plates. We were wrong, but it's still worth visiting. It's more than worth visiting. It's among the best food we had while spending six days in New Orleans. Dining around 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday in April, here's our experience.

1) Food: Everything we ate was delicious starting with the oysters and ending with the wagyu burger, which my seven-year-old daughter enjoyed too. The sunchokes are unique and worth ordering. My mother-in-law loved the squid ink pasta and my wife really enjoyed the buffalo tofu lettuce wraps (what they are known for).

2) Drink: Their menu includes cocktails, beer, wine, and more. I ordered a rainbow sherbet sour ale. My wife liked their brine drink for a savory option.

3) Service: From the hostess to the server, everyone was kind, efficient, and welcoming. Our food was perfectly timed.

4) Space: It's beautiful with a large indoor dining room and a bar. There are two unisex restrooms in the back near the stairs to the second level, which I assumed was for staff only.

5) Area: We found free street parking nearby. Located inside Bywater, it's a great neighborhood to walk around after dinner, finding little houses and parks. For dessert, we walked to nearby Big O's Original Popsicle Doorbell.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaE5qM2N3EAE,New Orleans,en
"Walked in without reservation on Saturday night and they were able to seat us within 20mins. Food is delicious with tons of veg and non-veg options. Cocktails were really good - the pho infused gin cocktail was my favorite
Service is a bit odd, our server was amazing but when food came around it seemed like any staff at the restaurant could grab it and almost dump it on the table. Bit of an odd contrast.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHF6V09nEAE,New Orleans,en

Fish dip: excellent starter!!!

Tuna tataki was good

Black eyed peas dip was enjoyed

Squid link pasta: well balanced, a little kick, not overcooked, good texture noodles

Friends said the gnocchi was ""the best they've ever had""

One of the few places truly with good options for vegetarians. We all loved our server as well. Call to get a reservation for a group.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcTQtbUlBEAE,New Orleans,en

Please try the melted Brie appetizer and any panini they‚Äôre all amazing. If anything the server was pissy about us all being there and ordering in disorganized times which I get but he lectured us for it.

Yikes. In a food and service oriented town it should not take 45 minutes to get a glass of wine with a half empty restaurant.

Unprofessional management. Still waiting on a W2 that should have been sent out in January. Had to report them to the IRS for withholding, as I don‚Äôt think they ever filed paperwork that I worked for them. Also had a HELL of a time getting paid when I worked for them.

However the music is LOUD and can be explicit which doesn‚Äôt make a great family friendly place even before it gets dark. Even more unfortunate we were seated right by the DJ booth.

Due to the loud music we ended up getting a couple of apps and drinks rather than a whole meal. Apps and drinks were great. Staff was kind. Just unfortunately the atmosphere is really unappealing.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dVpLQzhnRRAB,New Orleans,en

The food came out at a decent pace but we never met our server,  we didn't even know his name til he greeted another table an hour into our meal. His name is Mike.

"Oh. My. God. If you‚Äôre thinking about going - do it. Immediately.

We originally went as I was looking for a brunch restaurant that could accommodate my dad (he‚Äôs in a wheelchair/service dog), and we were also looking for something that prioritizes their food quality. Look, I like NOLA but I was tired of the standard, touristy, overpriced options. The pancakes in the Google listing + ability to make a reservation made the choice easy for us.

When we arrived we were greeted by the co-owner and immediately felt welcomed. It was an awesome surprise to also find that they offered delicious coffee options and we promptly ordered. We ordered an array of coffee (honey cinnamon latte, honey lavender latte, and iced vanilla bean logged - all delicious!) and for food the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, BLT, and Hot Chicken & Honey Biscuit. The pancakes are INCREDIBLE. My mother - who LOVES pancakes - was obsessed with them. The BLT was great and the hot chicken was so-so, but was made up by the delicious potatoes served as a side.

Upon leaving we immediately planned another day to come for breakfast for more pancakes. Upon our second visit we got more pancakes (the lemon + the Pigs in a Blanket), coffees, and the GM Plate. We were all satisfied and became curious on how they created the most perfect pancakes recipe. I‚Äôm not kidding - I hate pancakes and will now dream of them.

If you‚Äôre considering this place just do yourself a favor and go. Sure, the more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù choice is on the corner of the same strip, but it doesn‚Äôt compare to this place. Truly. The service, the atmosphere, and the menu are fantastic. Amazing!!

We had a great time here and love the casual atmosphere and happy people that works here. Highly recommend!,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdG9xUUNBEAE,New Orleans,en
"Today was my friends and I last full day in NOLA‚Ä¶ I chose a restaurant on the same block for brunch, but when we arrived it was a 40 min wait. District was right on the corner, so we walked over to see if the wait time was shorter.

We were seated right away!
And in many ways I‚Äôm really glad the original spot didn‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶ because what a gem this establishment is. The two chefs in the kitchen I‚Äôd like to give a kudos too! Because by far this was the most delicious meal I had this entire trip!

When our food arrived there was no salt and pepper‚Ä¶ and guess what! I didn‚Äôt need it! Everything perfectly seasoned and cooked!

When I return back to Louisiana, this will NOW BE MY GO TO SPOT!

The deejay is on it BUT if you've never been to plaxe like this before order the Pint of liquor and make your own drinks because the bottles behind the bar are very much watered down.

"I wouldn't know how the food was because I was completely ignored. I went this evening for a bite, asked the host if I could sit at the bar and eat, he said yes. I sat down and was ignored for at least 5 min, the bar was not busy at all there were maybe 6 people total including myself! FInally a woman came up to me said hi and I asked if I could see a menu, she gave me one and proceeded to clean up around me, helped several other patrons at the bar, I sat there another 5-7min with NOTHING in front of me, not even offered a water! I finally just left after I saw 4 men being attended to, they already had drinks and water! Then I saw another man being offered a refill on his wine to seats awsy from me, I was thinking this cannot be real, do they not see me? There was three people behind the bar. This was offensive and will spread the word not to bother going if your a woman eating alone, plain and simple rude and uncalled for. I was there early in the evening the dinning room wasn't even a little busy. In total I waited almost 15 min to see if anyone would come and apologize and take my order.

"Went for dinner on a Monday night with coworkers, we‚Äôre all also staying at the hotel. Reservation at 7:15, sat around 7:20. No one came by the table to even take appetizer orders for at least 20 minutes. A guy eventually came over with bread in that 20 mins and we asked him for our server.

I speak for the whole table when I say the overall service was subpar for the price, we each spent $50-100 to only have water filled once, if that, and a hefty wait in between ordering, receiving food, and checks. My check was also incorrect which ended up costing an extra 15 mins to fix that. Food was ok, but it‚Äôs not worth the languishing service attitude and several mistakes on the orders.

All in all, we were out a little after 9 and exhausted as we have to work each day starting at 6am. Likely won‚Äôt be back unless it‚Äôs room service or bar food.

Edit: I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect this review to carry any weight in the world at all, not even in the slightest. I assumed it would get lost within all reviews never to be seen again. But within hours of me posting the hotel set out to make it right which is crazy. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize the hotel is so involved with the restaurant or even cared what went on in it! Anyway, I gave a couple stars back for their trouble to do so, thank you!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkd0pYeVlnEAE,New Orleans,en

We also ordered the tandoori lamb burra. The lamb chops were succulent and the mint chutney was the perfect accompaniment. The Manso Kosha (goat) was fall apart tender and the sauce was a nice ratio of sweet with a spicy kick. Don't forget to get the Naan to finish off that sauce. We also ordered the chicken biryani that was flavorful and the chicken was tender. For drinks we tried the spicy Rita with tamarind and a gin cocktail with peach, both very tasty. I am so thankful for our server (I wish I remembered his name). He was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations on what to order and tips of how to eat the different food with their chutnies.

It turned out that the grits mixed well with the shrimp sauce and the melty cheese, which tasted a bit salty. The biscuit was a separate order, but I am glad that I ordered it because if I ate the grit alone it would be too salty for me. By the way, the biscuit was quite buttery but not fluffy enough.

I went there before 9 am on Saturday. No need to wait. When I left, however, people were already forming a line outside.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqM3FiT29RRRAB,New Orleans,en

"We had reservations for four at 8pm. Place was packed. Our table wasn't ready for about 30 minutes but we were eventually seated. We ordered drinks and the $6 bread service immediately. We all did either the three-course or four-course dinners which were easy and priced well. I added an A' La Carte Mixed Lettuce & Arugula ""Wedge"" salad which wasn't the best. The lettuce was a bit warm and wilted like they had it under a heat lamp. My daughter had the Little Gem Caesar Salad which was extremely too fishy from the anchovies. They took it back. We did the Creamy Shrimp Bisque, Escargots En Croute (very good), Pelican Club Baked Oysters, two of the Braised Pork Shanks, Louisiana Cioppino - In Its Own Pot, two of the Decadent Chocolate Cakes, and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding.
Everything was decent but they were too busy and our only server just couldn't keep up. They really need some support servers for drinks, bread, and table clearing.

"Went there for dinner with a childhood friend last week.

We started with an order of 4 of the appetizers intending to do a tapas kind of thing for dinner. (Everything but the pate).

The server was adamant that we had to select an entree. We explained that we wanted to look at the menu some more.

Truth be told, I had looked at the menu and honestly nothing spoke to me. I'm a bit of a simpleton and prefer simple food cooked well. The offerings here are a lot of things, simple isn't one of them.

After a bit of a stand off, the server departed in a huff with our order.

The appetizers were good, but like everything else there is just too much going on for me. Too many flavors competing on your tongue.

Eventually we ordered gumbo and a caprese salad.

The gumbo was simply okay. I had had a significantly better cup of gumbo at a popular restaurant in bucktown the night before. In addition there was a very slight fishy taste to the gumbo telling me it wasn't the freshest thing in the world.

The caprese salad was fine except for the balsamic vinegar, which was the refined version that is sweet. Typically the refined is put on ice cream and such. Don't know if it really works on a salad, definitely not for me.

I guess this all would have been ok if the bill for 3 people wasn't $300.

Not recommended.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dzlIcllnEAE,New Orleans,en

"I ordered duck gumbo and asked multiple questions. What kind of duck? Is the sausage peeled?  The manager did not know the answer to either question.

The gumbo soup was bitter.  The duck was chewy--normal. I informed Gabrielle I found the soup bitter. She did not respond to my query until I asked twice, and she said the roux is very dark but not burnt.

If a gumbo tastes bitter the roux is burned.

The bread and butter was delicious.

The club soda was very refreshing, but the glass of Pinot Noir average.

Great food, great employees - felt like home. Unfortunately, we didn't discover their lunch menu until the last day (try the muffaletta - I wanted to take some home!) It was so soft and flavorful.  Lots of options too.  While it didn't affect us - they have a bar, too!
The servers were very positive and friendly! The two we used (and enjoyed) were Dymond and Jamayra. Mena only does breakfast/lunch and that is fine. However, we would have lived there if they did dinner too!

It was. I now know why. It was a $25 plate. I was happy to support. At checkout the girl adds 18% tip to my purchase and tried to just skip through to have me sign. I'm staring at the handheld machine thinking, ""did she just put 18% on my order and not at least tell me??"" They get my food together and then she realizes she didn‚Äôt add my side of plantains I ordered. So it's going to be another $5. I watch her the second time and sure enough i see her pause and then quickly select the 18% again.  So then i ask her. She said a bunch stuff that makes absolutely no sense ""it's going to charge you $5 so im fixing it‚Ä¶"" Sure. I finally look at her realizing she's not disclosing how shes pricing all of this and isn't going to tell me the truth. I get home, eat my side of plantains, they're what I wanted. I open up my plate and I'm dumbfounded. Half the plate is rice. I tried it, it was ok. I thought it was meant to be a side, but it was most of the styrofoam container. I try the mac n cheese. Meh‚Ä¶it was not worth the dairy issues to eat it (for me). My mom and I do make really good mac though, so I'm bougie lol. But the OXTAIL wad an afterthought!

The chef elevated the fried green tomatoes and chicken biscuit to an award winning level. The chicken biscuit was smothered in jalape√±o's, scallions and the best rue I have ever tasted so I sent my compliments to the chef. Every delectable bite forced my eyes shut so I could deeply enjoy the freshness, flavor and texture. While I was enjoying coffee the chef sent complimentary Rosemary & Lemon Custard Madeline's. It was an innovative way to approach this classic pastry. My only critique is the custard on top was so good I wanted more. Very light, fresh, and balanced melody of flavors. The consistency was reminiscent of a fusion between a scone and puff pastry. You can tell the French invited fries by how well the fries here complimented every dish. It was such a phenomenal experience, I found myself making reservations for the next day halfway through brunch and I am happy to say the food, service and entertainment are consistently great here.

Besides food, St. Roch is also a great studying location. The building has plenty of windows and tables, making it perfect for work. There's also a wonderful coffee shop as well that serves delicious drinks and pastries.

Also, the service here is wonderful. Although each booth has its own employees (they're okay) the stars of the show are the St. Roch ""waiters."" They constantly clean the tables and make sure you have iced, filtered water along with your meal.

If you want to go to a place that'll make you question your decision-making skills, this is the place!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaGNESzdnRRAB,New Orleans,en

"the restaurant is incredibly beautiful.   we were the first people in the dining room at 515 on Monday.   We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees.   The waitress recommended the porkchop, describing it as  ""juicy"".  My wife's meal was good.  My porkchop was overcooked and dry.  I ate about 30% of it, hoping ""juicy"" would be in the middle somewhere.   I mentioned that to the other waiter (every table has 2) and he laughed like I was telling a joke.

The subtle complaint is lost on this place.   if you get poor quality like I did, I would recommend just sending it back.   Another oddity, they don't clear plates between courses.   The man literally shoved my plate to the other side of the table spilling the silverware on the tablecloth in the process.

"Visiting the quarter and wanted some Chinese, so this was one of the first spots we kept seeing show up online.

The best two items were: The crab/crawfish dumplings, fantastic. And, the saut√©ed green beans. They are crisp and hot, but still tender inside. A bit too much sauce for me, though.

Runner ups: The steamed pork buns. Stuffed with a good amount of meat inside, they were super fresh and soft. The basil popcorn chicken. So crispety and crunchy, and served piping hot. Egg rolls were different than traditional ones. Not as much of a cronch on them, but still good.

The char siu pork was sadly probably my least favorite item. It needs more char, and less of whatever sauce they're using, they need more of that traditional red sauce (see photos).

The service was lacking - took a long time to get our initial drinks, forgot to put in our order of oysters so we didn‚Äôt get those until after our entrees, kept pushing us to order as soon as he took our initial drink order, and we asked him if we could change our table‚Äôs TV since it looked like a personal one - he said he would ask, but he never even told us yes or no - I have a feeling he never asked.
The atmosphere was okay. Again, we went hoping we could watch the LSU baseball game since there were a lot of TVs, but we never got an answer if we could change it. The actual seats we sat in though were comfortable.
The food was overall good! Our entrees were yummy. Unfortunately, when the oysters finally did come out, they were the smallest oysters I have ever eaten. You could barely tell they were in the shell. And they were $32 for TINY oysters.

We requested a change of table twice, due to the location of the (way too many) TV screens everywhere, and the staff was very accommodating.

Our server Luka was outstanding, providing thoughtful recommendations, as well as prompt and friendly service. He went over and above to get our beverages just how we wanted. For food, The charbroiled oysters were a standout- the best out of 3 different spots we‚Äôve tried them in this trip. We also enjoyed the pesto pasta dish, which had a nice balance of fresh and spicy flavors. And the turkey club was good, too.

I didn‚Äôt love the blaring TVs everywhere theme. It seems like having the gigantic multiple screen spread over the bar would be plenty for those who are there to watch sports in a group setting.

"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to grab some breakfast and this place was highly recommended and had great reviews. We arrived and were seated immediately which was great as there were only 3 other tables with customers at them but it took over 15 minutes before we were attended to. The hostess came by about half way through and said ‚Äúshe comin ya‚Äôll‚Äù. The waiter came over apologized and took our food and drink orders and then disappeared in the back again for more than 20minutes. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit and my boyfriend got a brunch burger. Someone else brought out our food and they had my breakfast sandwich on toast instead of a biscuit as I ordered and when I told her it was supposed to be on a biscuit she then asked me ‚Äúwell do you want me to take it back?‚Äù My boyfriend‚Äôs brunch burger was supposed to have cheese, bacon, egg and a patty on it and it came out with no bacon or cheese. We had to send that back as well. By the time they brought both of our plates back out our food wasn‚Äôt even hot. Our waiter came out and apologized for the mix up then went in the back again and we had ask the busser once we were done eating for our check bcs our waitress was still in the back.

Overall, our waiter was not attentive at all and we had to search for her whenever we needed something when there were only 3 other tables with customers in the whole place. when the food finally came out it was wrong and then by the time it was remade and brought out it was cold.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeHFUNEx3EAE,New Orleans,en

It is 100% most definitely SURIMI, which is IMITATION CRAB made out of fish. Restaurants are not even allowed to advertise one type of meat but switch it for another. This is against some kind of regulation. I also ordered fried oysters which I usually like. But these ones tasted hard and old.

I want to go back to New Orleans so I can eat here again. They have a separate vegan menu that has so many great choices-including beignets! So hard to find vegan beignets so I was SO happy to have found this place. Everything was delicious. My husband ordered from the regular menu and he enjoyed his meal as well.

It wasn't until I looked again a second day that I found beignets under dessert way down at the bottom of the page (okay--I can see that, I guess) and (really confusing) pancakes mixed in with the breakfast sandwiches. The sausage patty was the worst! a blackened orange-ish mush. I went back for beignets, and I'm so glad I did! I am sure they are also probably amazing for lunch. I saw someone else's brunch food and it looked fresh and gorgeous. They said they open at 10am and close at four.

"I was visiting New Orleans for a business trip April 15-17. I came across Meals From The Heart on TikTok. I decided to try this restaurant because the reviews on TikTok were good. Upon arrival I met the cashier. Her service was OK. I ordered the crabcake, a small gumbo and a cold pressed orange juice. I was really excited about the food as I haven‚Äôt had any good vegan food since I visited New Orleans. A lot of the restaurants that I wanted to visit were closed or had closed early. I first tried the gumbo and it was OK. I wish that it had more rice, vegetables and mushrooms. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct way to describe it, but it was very loose and not very thick. The next thing I tried was the crabcake and it was OK. If it were not for the sauce I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been that great. The orange juice however was pretty good. Overall with tip I spent about $40. The crabcake alone was $10. My suggestion is that For $10 you should get two crabcakes and the gumbo should be thicker maybe add some more vegetables, mushrooms and rice I left feeling unsatisfied. I was disappointed with the portion of food I received for the amount of money I spent.

"This place has good food with lots of vegan/ vegetarian and gluten free options. It is very much a pick up food spot since it is in the market area. The market does have seating nearby, if not there are park benches around the market as well, but I took it for pick up to a bar that does not serve food. I had the vegan crab cake po‚Äôboy which was good, so I can only imagine that the traditional crab cake po‚Äôboy is amazing as well! I would most definitely come back to try that out or any of the other delicious looking options. They had a variety of food options with a lot of traditional New Orleans fares as well like red beans, okra gumbo and beignets. So I would say this is a great place to try some true NOLA foods. Also, true to the NOLA spirit, they also sell alcohol! Yay!

The chicken was extremely dry, there was A LOT of it though so there's that? Might have been what made it hard to swallow but the Taziki was also super dry, paste like, and there were no tomatoes and light lettuce.

"We visited Blue Bayou later in the evening when we were out looking for an after dinner drink and some dessert. The atmosphere looked inviting, and a quick review of their sidewalk menu lead us to believe we had found the place.  There weren‚Äôt many people in the restaurant but the bartender looked like a ball of frenetic energy. She was running around and asked us if we had been waited on yet, we said no and then she rushed away. A few minutes later, an engaging server stopped by and took our order. We ordered two desserts and four drinks. The desserts arrived long before the drinks and were not as shown in the menu. The menu describes a large slice of banana fosters cheesecake topped with sliced bananas and whipped cream. We received a sliver of cheesecake with no bananas. The sliver wasn‚Äôt enough for two. Three of our four drinks arrived after we finished our desserts, one drink was MIA. Mine was supposed to have rum in it but I couldn‚Äôt taste any. I chalked that up to the nutmeg on top. Another drink was supposed to be a lemon drop and tasted like water and lemon. We knew, with 100% certainty that the drinks were heavily watered down when the fourth drink finally arrived. It was supposed to be one of their signature drinks, an Old Fashioned. What is typically a beautiful dark caramel liquid, with a small amount of ice, dark cherry, bitters, sugar or simple syrup and maybe an orange slice came out looking like a slightly beige glass of water with a maraschino cherry and filled to the brim with ice. It was so watered down that the bourbon was hardly detectable. No simple syrup or sugar was used. And the bitters that make an OF so special were missing as well.

"My wife and I had a terrible experience with this establishment. There were warning signs early that we ignored, so ultimately we could have avoided our lackluster dining experience.
We walked up to the hostess station and were greeted by a young woman who was in the middle of dealing with her false eyelashes falling off, so we waited while she dealt with her personal emergency. She was very nice and apologetic for it, I'm sure that she was quite embarrassed. The restaurant wasn't busy at the moment, maybe a total of 5 tables, this is a large restaurant. We waited roughly 5 minutes for our server to greet us, placed a drink order along with an appetizer order. The server brought our waters and said our drinks would be out shortly. We started hearing the kitchen yelling for service for several minutes, the wait staff were elsewhere at this point, and then we started seeing the kitchen staff attempting to bring out the orders themselves. They were obviously confused as the whole each item was supposed to go to, but they were making an attempt. Kudos to the back of house for making an effort. They did make some negative comments about their coworkers as they were returning to the kitchen, we were sat by the kitchen so got to be the audience.

We received our appetizer after a few minutes of it being passed around from person to person before finally making it's way to our server.
We waited 10 minutes for our drinks to finally make it to our table, not promising for such a large business that wasn't busy. We had ordered the crab cake appetizer, it was very small, good flavor and quite a lot of crab for what looks like a 3 ounce cake. I would have been a little happier for either a little more or little less expensive ($26), this is obviously in the heart of the tourist trap but this was egregious even with that in mind. My entree was delivered within minutes of the drinks and appetizer. I had ordered the Blue Bayou shrimp Poboy, I was surprised by how much shrimp was on the sandwich especially after how small the appetizer was. My food sat on the table untouched for nearly 10 minutes before our server came to check on us, finding my wife's entree had never been delivered. She went back to the kitchen to check, came back out to apologize and said that the missing entree would be delivered shortly. We waited another 15 minutes for my wife's shrimp and grits entree, my food was now cold and we began eating our dinner.
The Poboy was not bad, even for being cold, it lacked some of the bold flavor you would expect for a Creole BBQ shrimp poboy but was more than edible. The side of fries were very good, large portions of shrimp and fries.
My wife said the shrimp and grits were okay, not as good as the same dish from the Ruby Slipper I had ordered for breakfast on the same day for significantly less money. But she did enjoy the dish well enough.

The server did offer to comp a glass of wine to make amends for the poor timing of the service, we declined and finished our meal. We found the service at this restaurant to be seriously lacking compared to the other establishments we visited during our visit to the city. The prices were on par with higher end establishments, but it falls short of the competition in my experience. We didn't walk in with any expectations, but we left disappointed with the overall experience.  We would not return or recommend this restaurant. There are too many great places to enjoy good food and drink in this city, avoid this lackluster tourist trap.

**Also of note - this restaurant charges an additional 3% on card payments, and they're a cashless business. So expect all prices to be an additional 3%***",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbnVhblFBEAE,New Orleans,en

The night before going to Dooky Chase I googled the restaurant. I read up on the history, dress code and hours. It never said you had to make a reservation. We struggled to find a Uber. I was so excited!!  We get to Dooky Chase and the lady asked me what did I want. I thought she was joking but she wasn‚Äôt. I told her we came to eat. Why else would we be there. She was so rude.

"My husband and I were determined to have dinner here. Dooky Chase is only open for dinner on Friday & Saturday evenings and reservations were hard to get. I ended up calling there one afternoon right before they closed to make our reservation.

The inside of the restaurant is beautifully elegant, filled with gorgeous art. I had the fried chicken, which was delicious and just a bit spicy, and my husband had the stuffed jumbo shrimp. We ended up taking a box home. I recommend the rum punch as a cocktail. We finished off with some piping hot praline bread pudding.

The service was excellent and we were glad we got an opportunity to eat here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdVBxcGh3RRAB,New Orleans,en
"After years of trying, we finally coordinated the timing of a visit to New Orleans that allowed a reservation for lunch at Dooky Chase. It also coincided with a monster rain storm that saw crazy street flooding with 6 inches per hour falling from the sky and submerging the streets.

The staff could not have been more welcoming, nor the dining room more elegant. I absolutely had to try the Creole gumbo, and it's now my favorite gumbo in New Orleans (sorry, Mr. B""s).  The meal was excellent, the service above and beyond. And with suggested wine pairing were spot on.

When it was time to leave, the water was up to the steps leading out to the street. The hostess insisted we leave through the back door where the water had not yet reached and led us through the kitchen, a fascinating side trip by itself. She then waited with us in the parking lot under our Uber arrived. Talk about commitment to customer service!

It was a wonderful experience on an historically bad weather day.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbUx5U2VREAE,New Orleans,en
"AVOID this restaurant!!! One of worst dining experiences ever. We had reservation at 05:30 for 5 people and when arrived we were told to head to bar had a mix up for our table. No one ever came to get us after said would just be a few minutes . We headed back up to hostess desk after waiting for amount of time we were told. We stood another couple minutes in the line near hostess desk and were finally called. The hostess desk is very unorganized and whole reservation system is very poorly managed. We headed to our table at 05:50 we didn‚Äôt get waited on until 06:20 and this was after several waiters walked by and the large table behind us sat after us and got waited on before us . We waited over an hour for our food and we had to have someone from our table go to host desk and inquire about order because our waitress disappeared. She then came by table after inquiring about order and told our ticket was up next it was an hour and ten minutes to get four entrees. I understand delays happen but your staff shows no care or concern . We talked to ‚Äúkitchen manager ‚Äú and host at desk and they showed no concern. No manager ever came by table to check in which is so bizarre . After stating how long waited for food the waitress said can offer dessert on the house. After one of us said just take their one entree off before we got food, she had to realize we waited too long. At this point we just wanted to leave it was ridiculous it took that long as other people that sat after us and only had 2-5 people in party and had over 5 tables  around us that got food before us. This establishment is severely lacking in customer service, hospitality and atmosphere. Stay away unless you want to have bad dining experience and poor customer service. Lastly, tried to contact restaurant thru their  email listed on website and email does not even work! It got returned as undeliverable email address  . It was a shame no one in management came by table to check in or apologize , even after several staff members were aware what happened with our service.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREa2RyRTVnRRAB,New Orleans,en

"While strolling the heart of Bourbon Street, stride into a world of refined elegance at Galatoire's in New Orleans, where over 100 years of tradition converge with exquisite culinary craftsmanship. From the moment you enter through its French doors, you are enveloped in an atmosphere of sophistication and old-world charm. You are treated to a dining experience that is both traditional and refined, a true celebration of Louisiana's rich culinary heritage*. Impeccable service and classic Creole dishes await each bite a testament to the restaurant's commitment to excellence. It is a place where tradition meets innovation and where every meal is an unforgettable celebration of food, family, and community.

What I Tasted: The appetizer quartet showcased flavors from the indulgent crab maison to the crispy fried oysters. For the main course, fresh local saut√©ed fish adorned with seasonal crawfish Etouff√©e. The fish had a delicate yet rich flavor profile that melted in your mouth. The optional lemon caper beurre blanc sauce, with champagne, was the perfect complement to the fish, adding a velvety smoothness and subtle acidity and saltiness to each bite.

 Standout Feature: their unwavering dedication to preserving Creole traditions while infusing modern flair sets it apart. With every bite, you are transported to a bygone era of refined dining, where the vibrant culture of Louisiana comes to life.

 What Was Mid: While some may find the classic decor and attentive service charming, others may perceive it as slightly rigid or stuffy. It has all the qualities of rigid service, former attire, and feeling of exclusive clientele but without the real upscale elegance of refined dining elements However, whether the ambiance suits your taste is subjective and may depend on your dining preference.

The oysters Rockefeller looked like they‚Äôd been under the food warmer for a while. Couldn‚Äôt taste the oysters.  The blackened pompano was 1/2 of a barely legal pompano. So little meat. The Key Lime tart was good. Sad. Won‚Äôt be back.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqc1ppMEJ3EAE,New Orleans,en

"Goodness this food was absolutely horrible. I am so astounded at the good reviews for this place. My husband and I were really looking forward to a lovely lunch on our honeymoon, but we both couldn‚Äôt even eat our entrees and had to send them back‚Ä¶ absolutely no flavour. Presentation was crap. My husband wasn‚Äôt wearing a ‚Äújacket‚Äù so we were put into a seperate peasant room which literally had seperate bathrooms and exits, I‚Äôve never felt so poor in my life ü§£ü§£ and food is one thing my husband and I are more than happy to spend big on, if it‚Äôs worth it!

"This restaurant is definitely overhyped in New Orleans. Securing a reservation can be tough, which might give you the impression that everyone is clamoring to dine at Galatoire's. They enforce a formal dress code, and if you arrive without a jacket, they'll provide you with one if you want to sit in the main dining area. You'll quickly notice that the clientele tends to be on the older side.
Once you're seated and handed the menu, the waiters are quite focused on upselling you on various items. We opted for a crab salad to start, and honestly, it was presented in the most disappointing manner I've ever seen from a high-end restaurant. Our main courses, shrimp creole and crab sardou with spinach and artichoke, also lacked in presentation. While the taste was decent, it fell short of gourmet standards, especially given the price.
Service wasn't particularly efficient either; we observed waiters wandering around aimlessly. I'm not trying to criticize the place unfairly, but I truly don't believe it deserves to be ranked among the city's top restaurants. If you adjust your expectations accordingly, you may be able to avoid disappointment.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeDZuWWFBEAE,New Orleans,en
"3rd visit. First two were amazing, and this time definitely not......

We prefer to not dress up too much and sit in the bar area, and have always loved every minute of it. This time we were told the bar area was full (even though there were clearly empty tables) so we were led into the secondary dining area and it's a whole different world and not for us. We didn't order wine and my wife wasn't too hungry so only ordered a salad and a side dish, and the waitress didn't seem to be happy about that and didn't pay much attention to us. Also the bar area is calm and laid back but both dining are as loud as a high school cafeteria and for some reason no one even tries to keep their voices down. We could clearly identify voices from multiple tables across the room and it seemed to be normal. When my drink was gone she took it away and didn't ask if I wanted another. So no dessert for us, we ate and left. Would go back again, and put our foot down for the bar area, but not sure how much leverage we'll have with a $50 deposit on our reservation.......",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNXZmeVJBEAE,New Orleans,en
"A disappointing experience all around. The service is inattentive and rests on their notoriety assuming everyone will just agree it‚Äôs amazing. We arrived for a 6:30 reservation and was told as we started to order that there was no crab available. Over half of their menu are crab based dishes. This seems to be a problem with sourcing and ensuring the restaurant is properly prepared to serve what‚Äôs on their menu. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller and were very disappointed. There were no bread crumbs to be found on these oysters, the spinach looked like someone dumped a can of goopy spinach on top, and they over baked the dish. I could bounce my fork off of the stiff spinach goop on top of the oyster. I waited for my waitress to ask how it was as we only ate two of them‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt ask, and when she came to remove them, I informed her they were not good. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my boss‚Äù and carried them away. The ‚Äúboss‚Äù did not come to check with us and they indeed did charge for them. The main entres were mediocre and nothing to rave about. The service was ‚Äúbarely check the box‚Äù and a bit arrogant. Sadly, another overrated restaurant that rests on their past reputation. Don‚Äôt fall for it‚Ä¶ go find a lovely restaurant where they care about your experience.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREbmRUR3BBRRAB,New Orleans,en

"I came here with a group of friends after we were walking down the street for a quick lunch spot. I wish I had read the reviews before coming here. I ordered a pasta dish, and the food was flavourless, bland, and overpriced for what it was. As for the restaurant itself, the floors were sticky, the bathroom was dirty, and the place looked like it was in desperate need of a revamp.

"Coming into the restaurant, my group of friends and I were expecting to get a nice, QUICK, tasty meal. But, we were met with the exact opposite. To start, we were greeted with a foul stench of cigarettes and weed. Something definitely not appropriate for most people especially young children and teens. Now, onto the food. The pastas were bland and my marinara pasta had a pool of water on the bottom. The sandwiches were not any better. They were salty, chewy and had an uneven texture. To add on, after the span of 5 seconds, the gravy from the roast beef quickly transferred to the bread and made it extremely soggy. Hence adding to its uneven texture. Not only that, the plates were dirty. The restaurant was also unable to record their orders properly, thus leaving my friends to starve and suffer as they watched everyone else eat. My friends and I then checked the reviews on the restaurants. They talked about recent food poisoning, and other liabilities. As soon as we read these reviews, it became clear that they were true. Finally, we would like to end with a warning; please do not come to this restaurant as the food does not taste good,  the restaurant does not practice hygiene, and is overall unsafe.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMGRUUlNBEAE,New Orleans,en

If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. The guy that it making sandwiches will do without gloves, a minute later he went out to smoke and come back to make more sandwiches without gloves or washing his hands.

The whole place looked dirty, it smelled horrible and the floor was sticky, itself is disgusting.

"We walked in and sat at the bar because we were told the earliest seat we could get was over 1.5hr wait. It‚Äôs a Thurs night and we had no reservation so that‚Äôs not unusual- sign of a good restaurant, right?

At no point while we were there (almost til 8) did the restaurant even approach 2/3 full. Maybe a bunch of no shows? Or maybe it‚Äôs because the food just wasn‚Äôt good.

We started with the Provola sausage appetizer that was OK, but tasted kind of lemony - maybe the oregano was just way too heavy? But the sausage definitely didn‚Äôt stand out.

Then, after over a 25 min wait including us promoting the bartender to check, I had spaghetti fra diavolo. I expect a little spice in fra diavolo, but it was pure black pepper that I tasted. No tomato, chili, basil or lemon. The shrimp were rubbery to boot. Did not finish. And we had paesano potatoes. The Parmesan was past the point of melting to nearly burnt on, there was no rosemary or garlic flavor. It didn‚Äôt even taste like it had salt or pepper (maybe they ran out after the spaghetti‚Ä¶).

And to top it off, the service was not good. We had to prompt them to check for our food after we had been sitting for 25 min. Generally when sitting at the bar, the bartender will check on your drinks to see if you like them - esp when one has an empty cocktail glass.

This place was AMAZING. Everything, the food, service, ambiance, bathroom, and cocktails.

I brought my brunch bunch in this last Saturday for the bottomless deal. We had a 12 top and never wanted for a thing!

I was actually SURPRISED at how effective the mimos were, despite the fact that they mixed them for you (not my favorite thing and I had called ahead and was told they specifically DID NOT DO THIS, but it all turned out to be just fine).

Everything everyone ate was DEVINE. Not a single complaint to be had by my party of 12. That's quite a feat. I was having so much fun I didn't even get pictures of the food!

I had the boudin has, delicious but the star of the show (besides of course our AMAZING, SWEET, PATIENT, BUTT KICKING server, Tara ?I think)) was the crawfish pie. It was more like a pot pie, with poached eggs. Absolutely DELICIOUS. And sooooo my charbroiled oysters to choose from!

"First place we ate when we got to New Orleans and we seriously discussed eating there every night.  Everything was so good!  I never knew how good scallops are supposed to be.  These were buttery and melted in your mouth.  The Louisiana crawfish Pie was amazing!  The crust had such a good flavor.  The show stopper, however, was the beignets.  Seriously better than Cafe Du Monde's......Gasp!!!  Yes, I said what I said.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEM0xiWWxBRRAB,New Orleans,en

"We arrived late at Intercontinental Hotel and wanted to have a drink and a snack. As per the hotel website we went to the hotel bar, Trenasse. Much to our surprise we were not able to charge the bill to our room. They told us the system was down and has been down for quite a while. There was no mention of this fact on the menu or signage at the bar. The manager apologized by saying ‚Äúsorry‚Äù at least a dozen times. She did not offer to comp us even one drink because of this inconvenience. We feel sorry for the staff who are disadvantaged by such a poor level of providing truthful information to customers by upper management.

I‚Äôm not sure if the host and server were judging us based on our age but the service was already lacking. Lily was our server and only took our orders and never came back.

We had two Thai teas, which were very good, better than our local Thai place.

Thirdly, the food, itself, is Fantastic. The portions are big. You won‚Äôt leave hungry. We got the falafel as an appetizer.

They treated us with the most respect and smile! 2nd, I would give them 10 stars for cleanliness! That made me feel really good because a lot of food places make you really pray over it!
Now here's the winner!! The Gumbo!! Since they were treating us like family, we shared the good news of why we were in town, celebrating  a birth! They gave my husband an extra container of Gumbo and glad they did! I told them I do not eat Gumbo but I'll taste some when we made it back to where we were staying! I was impressed and now I will say I will eat Gumbo but only from there and my husband really enjoyed his!

"We went to the Felix‚Äôs at the French Quarter the evening of 4/16/24. Not having been back to New Orleans for a few years, I was excited to return for the char grilled oysters. We have been multiple times in the past and the food has been great, and staff so friendly but unfortunately not this time. When arriving, there was an African American female hostess with glasses. Multiple tables were open but she told us we would have to wait for a 2 top table to be cleaned. We asked why we couldn‚Äôt sit at a 4 top, when she had seated other parties with 2 people at the 4 top tables. She smirked and refused to provide us with respond, instead just ignoring us. We made the decision to go elsewhere and when telling her same, she again just smirked as though she was proud of her actions. When we told the couple behind us of what happened, they also left the location and the hostess continued to smirk about her decision to treat us as she had. I made the mistake of calling the Lakefront location, instead of the French Quarter, and spoke to the supervisor. She was appalled by the fact an employee of Felix‚Äôs would treat customers as we were treated. She said the situation was totally mishandled and if it had been her location, she would have marched up front and made the situation right. She also recommended I write this review to advise the owner of what had happened. We have since left a voicemail for management, with no response but this type of customer service will keep me from returning. Instead, we went to Acme around the corner where the staff was friendly, food was great, service was efficient, and we weren‚Äôt discriminated against as we were by that hostess. Highly recommend Acme if you are in the area and looking for oysters and/or po boys! This situation was totally uncalled for by an employee in customer service when the restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy, and we were willing, paying customers.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdUwtRE13EAE,New Orleans,en
"It's a toss-up between Felix's and Acme for my favorite Oyster bar in New Orleans. I first went to Felix's decades ago, and I go to both when in New Orleans. At Felix's, I always start with a half dozen each of raw, char-broiled, and Oysters Bienville, and if still hungry, I get a Shrimp Po-boy.

I did miss the mac and cheese which used to be great.  Guessing they do a lot of takeout and delivery to area businesses but a cool place for a tourist to find and love.

I would recommend this place for ambiance alone but it turns out the service is fantastic and so is the food! This was one of the most fun restaurants we visited in New Orleans and it's definitely worth the trip in my opinion.

"On my 3rd visit to Mulantes I switched up my usual fried shrimp and fish order to a cheeseburger and fries! Hoping to experience more wonderful food from this restaurant I patiently awaited my order . I asked the waitress to ensure my burger was well done with no pink . After receiving the order I first noticed how small the burger was for $19.00 . I was the size of a small kids burger but more than that the burger appeared to be gray which caused me to break a piece of the  meat off and smell it! The meat had a spoiled small as if it was expired meat or left out for a long period of time . I asked my friends to also confirm the stink that the meat had and all 3 of us agreed that something wasn‚Äôt right with the meat. I asked the waitress to send it back and to take it off of my bill . Because I
Has hungry I asked to keep the fries . The manager never came to our table to apologize and told my waitress that nothing was wrong with meat ! Smh yes it was! I was charged $6.00 for a hand full of fries ! The manager walked right by our table and never apologised or said anything to me . I will never eat there again and started to scream out to the other guest Not to eat the Meat . I was told they will
Serve dog meat to their customers! They don‚Äôt care they just want the money . I am thinking about calling the health department on them and especially the female manager that felt that I wasn‚Äôt owed apology!

"The shrimp and grits here is amazing. The cheesy jalapeno grits made the dish with flavourful shrimp and sauce atop. The bone marrow was a bit disappointing in flavours. It needs some seasoning and refinement. My partner got the Bouillabaisse which looked great but we feel the dish needs rice instead of bread to really get that sauce. To end, we got the bread pudding which was delicious. I wish I stopped the waiter before he poured the entire serving of caramel sauce on top as I tend to prefer my desserts less sweet. Nonetheless it was great and the added pecans was a nice touch. I also tried the blackberry cocktail which was disappointing. The cocktail tasted alright but it was not cold enough and clearly had not been chilled or shaken with ice. I would skip the cocktails here. Service was friendly and attentive. The place is lacking AC (or maybe it was off) so it can get a touch warm.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNVlMT29nRRAB,New Orleans,en

"Luke is a great little French restaurant situated in the Central Business District just south of French Quarter. My wife and I went for lunch and we decided to go all in and try a couple of traditional French items we had never had.

We ordered three items from the ""To Share"" section of the menu. Here's what we ordered:
1) Pat√™ of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Liver
2) Crispy Brussels Sprouts
3) Escargot & Bone Marrow
4) Saison du Pont (beer from Belgium)

I have to say, neither my wife nor myself enjoyed the pat√™. To be fair, this stuff looked legit. I'm confident this was excellent quality and it just turns out we aren't pat√™ people. The sprouts were fantastic and I was a huge fan of the accompanying sweet pepper sauce. Bone marrow is always amazing, and this was no exception. We enjoyed the escargot and it paired quite well with the marrow and the grilled bread served with the dish.

Service was excellent, food was great quality, and we were in and out pretty quickly. Definitely recommended if authentic French food is what you're looking for.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcnVXc1NBEAE,New Orleans,en

We started with some cocktails that were pretty good, not too crazy. The entree platters were surprisingly big. I did not get to try them but my friends enjoyed. I had the gumbo and Peruvian scallop which were both tasty. Not wow, but good. 8.5/10. They also brought my friend a little dessert for her birthday which was so sweet! A burger was also ordered along with shrimp and grits, a bisque, and halibut I believe. I tried the shrimp and grits and it was GOOD. That stole the show for me.

We were thoroughly impressed with our meal. I had the fried porkchops with candied yams and potato salad. The porkchops were humongous compared to what I'm used to and they were fried perfectly. The candied yams and mashed potato salad were both addictive.

The hubby had the seafood pasta, fried fish, and jambalaya. The pasta sauce was flavorful, but he was sad there wasn't more crab that was noticeable. However he did love the jambalaya and wished he had gotten a double helping of it instead of a salad.

"Located in the heart of Lakeview, Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner stands as a cherished beacon of New Orleans‚Äô rich culinary tradition.

Since its inception in 1985, this diner has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to destination for exceptional breakfasts, weaving itself into the fabric of the city‚Äôs dining scene.

With a menu that spans the gamut from indulgent fried chicken and waffles to a diverse array of egg specialties, Russell‚Äôs caters to a broad spectrum of tastes.

Not forgetting the health-conscious, the diner also offers lighter fare such as eggwhite omelets and sweet potato pancakes, ensuring that every patron leaves satisfied.

The dining experience is further enhanced by the option to enjoy your meal either inside the diner‚Äôs cozy interior, at the counter where the local vibe thrives, in their inviting dining room, or outside on the pet-friendly patio, making it perfect for every occasion.

During my visit, I decided to try the legendary Egg Saints #33‚Äîa daring concoction that perfectly embodies New Orleans‚Äô flair for culinary innovation.

This dish features a grilled biscuit topped with alligator sausage, grilled tomatoes, poached eggs, and smothered in homemade country gravy.

Each component of the dish harmonizes to create a breakfast experience that is both unique and profoundly satisfying.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with the diner‚Äôs unmistakable local charm, enhanced by the friendly service that made me feel right at home.

The ambiance, a blend of the cozy and the communal, set the perfect stage for what was to be an unforgettable meal.

The Premier League playing softly in the background added a touch of camaraderie, reminiscent of a neighborhood caf√© where everyone is welcome.

The highlight of my visit was, without a doubt, the food.

The Egg Saints #33 was a revelation, transforming the classic eggs Benedict into a dish that captivated my palate and left me pondering the culinary prowess behind it.

Every bite was a testament to Russell‚Äôs commitment to quality and innovation, making it clear why this diner holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans‚Äô residents and visitors alike.

In a city lauded for its vibrant food scene, claiming the title of ""best breakfast"" is no small feat.

Yet, as I left Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner, I was already yearning to return and dive deeper into their menu.

This hidden gem is an absolute must-visit for anyone looking to experience the soul of New Orleans through its food, served with a side of unmatched hospitality.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEOWZmbklREAE,New Orleans,en
"Disappointed in the service tonight. Had dinner with my college roommate and our wives. We each ordered a starter and an entree after enjoying a drink. They brought the starters and the entrees at the same time. When I pointed this out, the server asked what I wanted. I told her that was up to her. So she did nothing. Then, when we were finished,  she asked if we wanted desert. I told her we'd like coffee after I finished my beer. I still had 1/2 a beer left when she brought the coffee. The staff started cleaning up around us.
