When given a numbered list of customer reviews, you examine each review individually. For each review, determine which of the 5 dimensions is most relevant to the review. Respond with the most relevant dimensions for each review, with every review having at least one labeled dimension. Only respond with the terms Reliability, Tangibility, Empathy, Responsiveness, and Assurance. The following are the definitions of the dimensions. Reliability: In a restaurant setting, reliability involves consistently delivering quality food and service. This means that meals are prepared correctly and served on time, reservations are honored promptly, and any issues are resolved efficiently to meet customer expectations. Tangibility: Tangibility in restaurants relates to the physical elements that represent the quality of service. This can include the cleanliness and decor of the dining area, the appearance of staff uniforms, the layout of the restaurant, and the design of menus and promotional materials. Empathy: In a restaurant setting, empathy is demonstrated through personalized service and attentive interactions with customers. It means understanding and accommodating dietary preferences, special requests, and creating a welcoming environment that shows genuine care for guests' needs. Responsiveness: Responsiveness in restaurants is the promptness with which staff attend to customers. This includes quickly seating guests, taking orders, serving food, and addressing customer inquiries or problems. Restaurants with high responsiveness ensure guests feel valued and well-attended throughout their visit. Assurance: Assurance involves the trust and confidence customers have in the restaurant's ability to deliver a safe and enjoyable dining experience. This can be achieved through staff knowledge, food safety practices, and professional handling of customer concerns. Customers need to feel that they are in good hands and that the restaurant prioritizes their well-being.\"\n","\n","# AI Controls\n","tokens = int(3000)\n","temp = 0 # According to OpenAI, as this value approaches 0, the GPT4 model becomes deterministic in its responses\n","model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n","\n","# Batch Controls 7(number of texts per query - need consider token limits, cost of retries, and size of failed batches)\n","batch_size = 25\n","\n","# Set random state (change this for each run when you take majority labels across multiple runs; see Ringel (2023))\n","seed = 33"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"139bba37","metadata":{"id":"139bba37"},"source":["**Notes on batch size:**\n","\n","- At the time of developing this notebook, the performance of OpenAI's API varied dramatically by\n","> *weekday* **x** *time of day* **x** *internet connection* **x** *model used* **x** *number of tokens*\n","- In general, I found:\n","    - smaller batches were less prone to API communication errors than larger batches.\n","    - longer texts work better in smaller batches\n","    - runtime dramatically increases during business hours\n","    - format of AI response deviates more during business hours and early evening, which can lead to errors in response processing\n","    \n","***My take-away:*** Create Synthetic Experts overnight on weekends and keep batch size at moderate level, especially for longer texts (i.e., more tokens)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a5b401b2","metadata":{"id":"a5b401b2"},"source":["# 3.
