Gene's Bistro,1,"TERRIBLE food for the price. The food was absolutely mediocre and paying over $20 per plate just ruined the meal experience. My pasta looked old, and paying the extra $6 for ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù chicken that tasted like canned chicken was a huge bummer. I would not be surprised if they just reheated my plate in the microwave. My wife‚Äôs salad was again mediocre and the chicken could very well have come out of a can. The fries were greasy and seemed old as well. My daughter‚Äôs spaghetti tasted old and dry. My son‚Äôs chicken tenders had a lot of bread and little chicken. To be fair the kids meals were $8.99. The place just seems to have zero accountability to make its food competitive since it‚Äôs at an airport and they can just let people come to them with no need to retain customers.

The duty free shop is tiny and hardly sells anything. There's a Hudson's general store type shop that's just about sold out and there selling two dry slices of bread with 3 slices of ham and a slice of cheese for $14.00. An absolute rip off.

Urban Olive The Mediterranean Table,5,"Alright, my expectations are pretty low because I‚Äôm grabbing a meal in a busy airport. BUT! I was pleasantly surprised by Urban Olive.

1. Super fast - like they had my meal out in seconds and it was fresh off the grill.
2. So friendly. Actually. I‚Äôve never had a friendly experience at an airport restaurant. Kudos to the staff.
3. Relatively healthy. It‚Äôs nice to have veggies and protein to fill up on before a long flight.
4. Surprisingly affordable. I would have expected to pay this for a quick-serve restaurant in the real world, and I didn‚Äôt feel price gouged.
5. The renovations in Terminal 5 are fresh and modern (finally) and make it a nice atmosphere for people watching and relaxing for a few minutes during a travel day.

Then, server tried to stear me towards the bar but she was out of luck because I said I wanted a table. She giv3s me a table and tells me to order online. What's the point of me waiting in line then? I can just sit myself and order if you are not really gonna be ""serving"" me. They had 3 - 5 options for breakfast and 2 options for drinks on the online ordering app. Ridiculous. I will never be back nor do I recommend it. I do have to say that I was at this Chilli's at 830 am.

Chili's Grill & Bar,2,"I hate these kind of reviews.

Hostess waved across the room to seat me, no instructions. I sit quietly for several minutes waiting on someone to take my order. A server shows up with no water or coffee. She informs me i have to order online via QR code. (Why have a server?) QR code menu doesn't match the advertising. Said advertisement is why I stopped to eat. You have to order and pay online while still expected to tip a server. Online payment portal messed up. Server told me I didn't pay for coffee. I apologized. I went back into the payment portal and reentered my info and card info to pay for the coffee. The portal now wants to charge me for two coffees. I ask the server to just take the coffee away. She does. She returns to say I've already paid for the coffee and can bring it back. Sigh. I decline, choosing to eat dryly some food I didn't want in the first place just to get on with my life.

Look at my reviews. I'm not given to negativity. But this restaurant ----.  You don't have the right culture. Your process is unfriendly, frustrating, and borderline combative.

Two stars because your server was friendly. She tried her best.

R.J. Grunts Burgers,1,"I paid nearly $16 for a burrito with scrambled eggs and overly fried tater torts. The expectation when you buy a meal in an airport is that it will be inflated in price and underwhelming, so that wasn't the issue. However, there were no employees at the front of house taking orders at the register. There were a couple of kiosks where I first tried to place my order, but the item I wanted to order came with bacon and there was no option to remove this on the kiosk. I waited for about 5 minutes for someone to come out and help me with my order. When the employee finally did come out she asked ""did everyone order at the kiosk?"" When I said I did not she said ""okay order at the kiosk."" Then walked away again. Then I waited a little longer for her to come back. I then explained I needed to request no bacon on the burrito I was trying to order and there was no option to do this on the kiosk. She verbally confirmed and walked away. So I went ahead and placed the order at the kiosk and it came out with no bacon, but also no pico de Gallo. So overall, very poor customer service and the staff, and an incorrect, overpriced, order.
