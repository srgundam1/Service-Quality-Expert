BurgerIM & Krispy Krunchy Chicken,3,"The place isn't the most appealing, but their food is great! I have lived in the immediate neighborhood (DC native born and raised otherwise) for about 2.5 years and only started going here last year off of a bartender's recommendation as what he called ""the best fried chicken"" when it came to ordering out. I doubted him, I did.

Now, I won't say it was the BEST, but it certainly was some real good fried chicken. And the pieces were great sizes. I always get dark meat, if that matters. Burgers, onion rings, and their biscuits are fantastic as well. When I did order burgers, always the Mushroom Swiss. But I haven't gotten anything but fried chicken there since last summer, so I can't say much about it today?

I must note, within the past few months, I've noticed their fried chicken is consistently smaller than they used to be. They taste fine still, but due to being significantly smaller, they're not as juicy. I unfortunately don't find it to be as worthwhile for that anymore. Maybe I'll try their burgers again and see if that changed at all.",2024-03-12T04:37:46.711Z,0,,33,TRUE,,,a month ago,,Dinner,$10–20,,Take out,3,5,4,ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5d1AwRBAB,,,,,,Google,,111410142455382668473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cafe Berlin,3,"We initially booked reservations and were confirmed for it. However, when we went, they seated us at the patio saying that we had outdoor dining confirmation and it was freezing cold.  There was no mention of outdoor dining in the confirmation.  They had a fireplace, but it didn't provide heat at all even though we were seated right next to it. They should at least have a couple of heaters outside if they put people outside for dining.  That's what other restaurants do.  They provided blankets, but it wasn't enough as it was super cold. They later seated us by the bar when some of the guests were gone. The service wasn't great as well as they messed up our order, and the little lamps provided outside weren't working.  We had to tell the server a couple of times about it. When we were seated back indoors, the server didn't help us out with carrying our water or food.  However, the guy at the bar was really nice and got our orders right.  He also made sure we were given all of our orders, and he checked on our orders.  All the pointers to him for giving us a good service than our previous server.  The food was okay too.  The sausage, salad, and sauted vegetables were the only good things at the place.  Everything else was okay.  I would definitely suggest checking out the food options beforehand as there are very few options for non-meat eaters.

Pho Viet USA,1,"TLDR: Busy casual spot, with an Americanized twist to Vietnamese food. Non-Vietnamese waiters do not know their menu. Food is edible.

I came in with a party of 8 Vietnamese some tourists and some local to Virginia. We were greeted promptly and politely from the waitress. Since there were 8 of us, a lot of menu items were ordered, which included egg rolls, spring rolls, rice, pho, and a vegetarian dish. The menu itself is very beautiful, but the actual food definitely looks nothing like what is pictured.

The service:
Our waitress was very nice, took our order, and repeated it to us. The appetizers came out within 10 minutes, but the main entrees came out, no exaggeration, 45 minutes later. I asked for extra beansprouts, as the existing amount they gave was enough for ants, and later on found out that they gave the entire table extra and charged for it. This would have been nice to know beforehand that this would be extra, which definitely was not the case. We also ordered a banh mi, but after over an hour, we told them not to bring it, as it was taking too long. Our drinks were full, but had to politely ask them for it.

The food:
The food all came out at sporadic times, with the children's food coming out 1 hour after the appetizers, again, no exaggeration. Given the restaurant's name, half of the table decided to order pho, and our waitress got it all wrong. We ordered the ""Pho Tai Nam"" and got the ""Pho Tai Lan"" My table being Vietnamese, pronouncing it correctly, thought that this non-Vietnamese waitress was pronouncing it incorrectly but giving us the correct order. Upon the first 2-3 bites, we were certain that we did not order this entrée, and asked the waitress and manager what this was? They kept repeating ""Pho Tai Lan"" and we were like this does not seem right. Anyways, I found a menu on another table that hadn't been pre-bussed in about an hour, and went through it. Saw that they had both a ""Pho Tai Nam"" and a ""Pho Tai Lan"" (For the record, there is no such thing as ""Pho Tai Lan"" so be aware that this proprietary to the restaurant. This is essentially beef pho with the beef being stir-fried with garlic and topped on the pho. sounds good but the beef was over-cooked and tough)
Message to the non-Vietnamese waitress: Please double check with your Vietnamese patrons on their Vietnamese order using your menu.

Management:
Management was a Vietnamese kid who spoke very softly and decided to give us 50% off of two bowls of pho (there were 4 total on our table), which was nice. We spoke to him in Vietnamese throughout our time in the restaurant to get things sorted out, but he was so timid and not confident in his communication. Not much got resolved.

Conclusion:
This restaurant is definitely catered more to Americans who would like to get a basic feel on what Vietnamese food is. The food is mediocre, at best, but maybe this restaurant is catering to the area. Pho Viet USA is a casual spot, with a fancy menu, and a poor food presentation. The prices are high, a little too high, given the food presentation, taste, service, and restaurant ambiance. Would I go back? No. Would I suggest this to an American? Yes. Vietnamese?

They seem pretty busy, and the Front of house almost always seems overwhelmed. A lot of the people working on the line? Are multitasking from fryers to the line and the cashiers aren’t able to handle ordering at 3rd party orders. The management team here is great! But I notice that the team needs to rely on those extra bodies to assist.
The restaurant being understaffed could be what’s contributing to poor guest experience because of the team feeling overwhelmed or understaffed.
If it’s in the budget to staff more? I would do so. Numbers can’t be the only focus here. Because customers are leaving unhappy",2024-03-24T16:42:45.874Z,0,,42,FALSE,,,a month ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcEktTzRRRRAB,,,,,,Google,,108576714382487153790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Marinara Beef Pasta suppose to come with spaghetti sauce, instead it came with some kind of white sauce, this is crazy, I never seen anything like this before.

Cinder BBQ,5,"Tell me where you can go to get outstanding BBQ, buy allocated bourbon by the bottle, watch games, smoke cigars on the patio on Saturday nights, and join their Wednesday whisky club? Our first visit to Cinder was a great experience. The owner and staff were welcoming. The Old Fashioned is reasonably priced and they use Sazerac. If you want a bottle of some great bourbons, look no further. As long as you buy some food, you're good to go. If you like pork rinds. Then you can't miss these... If you don't like them, then you have to order them just to listen to them keep popping at the table for 5 minutes after they are served. Sunday means brisket day. Chopped, sliced, platter or sandwich, or even by the pound. Pulled pork was outstanding. The 12 yr old loved the Mac n Cheese, we loved the collards, and the sauces were great depending on your taste. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample of all of them.

Their dedication to excellent customer service and professionalism are second to none and reflects great credit upon themselves and the Cinder BBQ brand. My overall rating undoubtedly is 5 out of 5 stars without hesitating. I will definitely be back for more of heir phenomenal BBQ. Raine, Silas, Autumn and Chef Ciara deserve big raises and the biggest recognition/honorable mention for their amazing friendly service, attentiveness and professionalism.

Mr. Braxton Bar & Kitchen,1,"The decor here is nice and a great atmosphere. However, everything else didn't line up. The service was just lacking. We waited about 15 min for a server just to come over to take the order, and then it was very hard to find her when we needed something.

It was a table of two and the restaurant wasn’t full but it took 30 minutes for the mimosas, another 20 minutes for them to find clean glasses for us to use (the first 4 they were bringing out dirty !!! ). Let’s not even discuss how long it took them to make chicken and waffles and an omelette!

The chicken is cooked is sazon and not hard so the chicken was rubbery and could still taste the flour and would leave yellow stains on your fingertips. This made it inedible. Only positive was the salmon omelette.

Lastly, a 20% service fee is added to the bill (this is your servers tip), this could explain the lack of attentiveness from the waiters or waitresses because the fee is not an option.",2024-04-23T11:13:42.380Z,0,,60,FALSE,,,a day ago,,Brunch,$100+,,Dine in,4,2,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNmQyLXp3RRAB,,,,,,Google,,113405967815661129873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roti Mediterranean Bowls. Salads. Pitas.,3,"Solid Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas topped with a variety of fresh ingredients and perfect for a relatively tasty, quick, and affordable meal. The concept is pretty similar to CAVA -- you can either build your own by choosing a base, main, and toppings, or you can pick from one of their chef-curated options. I usually opt to build my own with their salmon fillet or roasted butternut squash over kale, and topped with all the veggies and hummus. All of their veggies are super fresh, and their sauces all pack a ton of flavor (watch out for the spicy ones -- they actually are quite spicy). Their salmon fillets tend to be very small and a touch dry, as I assume they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, but they still pack a good flavor.

Although the food is solid, it's generally not my first choice for fast-casual Mediterranean fare, as (1) they're not always aware of which allergens are in their food, and (2) despite being a fast-casual spot, service can often be quite delayed.

Starting with the first -- the staff is wonderful at handling dietary restrictions; they'll put on new gloves, make sure your order is on a clean service (i.e., new foil or bowl), and avoid working on other orders at the same time as yours. However, I'm worried they haven't been told what all the allergens are in all of their ingredients. For example, I've received their gluten-free falafel pita box at several catered office lunches, and, unfortunately, ended up feeling pretty sick afterwards. Although I appreciate that they have a gluten-free pita (although it does taste pretty dismal) and that they have gluten-free options for desserts and sides, I don't believe their falafel is gluten-free (or maybe it's something in the rice or one of the toppings...I'm not entirely sure what it is or if there's just some cross-contamination, but something in those boxes definitely isn't sitting right with me).

Beyond dietary restrictions, the only other drawback to Roti is that it's not always as speedy as advertised, which is not at all the fault of the employees. Every time I go in, there are usually only 1-2 people working the entire restaurant, fielding a slew of both in-person and mobile orders. This naturally creates a delay in getting out all orders; for example, I'll sometimes wait upwards of 30+ min. for a line of five or so in-person customers because the staff is so swamped with mobile orders. On the flip side, if you get a mobile order, definitely go to pick it up instead of using their delivery service (which includes third-party apps like UberEats, as Roti opts to use their own drivers for those services). I usually have to wait over 45 min. for a delivery order, despite the quoted wait time of 15 min. and that my apartment is less than 2 miles away from the restaurant.

All in all, I think Roti is a solid place for fresh, flavor-packed Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas. However, I would recommend caution if you have dietary restrictions or if you're in a huge rush.",2024-02-27T02:48:58.020Z,0,,158,TRUE,2024-02-27T18:55:33.621Z,,a month ago,,Dinner,$10–20,,Take out,3,3,4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkczdhbmFnEAE,,,,,,Google,,105998029994332674723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shake Shack Union Station,4,"Nestled within the bustling confines of Washington, D.C.'s iconic Union Station, the Shake Shack outpost has firmly established itself as a must-visit dining destination for both commuters and tourists alike. As one of the nation's fastest-growing burger chains, Shake Shack has brought its signature blend of high-quality burgers, hot dogs, and frozen custard to this transportation hub, seamlessly integrating its vibrant, modern aesthetic into the station's historic architecture.

From the moment you step through the doors, the Shake Shack experience is defined by its warm, inviting atmosphere and attention to detail. The compact yet well-designed dining area features ample seating, both indoors and out, allowing patrons to enjoy their meals in comfort while taking in the bustling energy of the station around them. The clean, minimalist decor - complete with wood accents, subway tile, and the brand's signature neon signage - creates a sense of casual sophistication that perfectly complements the menu.

Of course, the real draw of this Shake Shack location is the food, and it certainly does not disappoint. The menu features all of the brand's signature items, from the classic ShackBurger, with its juicy beef patty and signature sauce, to the crispy, golden-brown crinkle-cut fries. But the real standouts are the Shake Shack-exclusive offerings, such as the Union Shack Burger, which pays homage to the location's iconic setting with a unique blend of toppings.

Beyond the standard fare, the Union Station Shake Shack also boasts an impressive selection of frozen custard concretes, shakes, and specialty beverages, catering to those with a sweet tooth or seeking a refreshing respite from their travels. The seasonal and limited-time offerings, in particular, have become highly anticipated and sought-after by the restaurant's loyal following.

What truly sets this Shake Shack location apart, however, is its seamless integration into the bustling Union Station environment.

Went here for dinner last night and everything was absolutely delicious. The fried chicken, fried catfish, lambs, crab cakes and sides of Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collards, potato salad, and corn bread were all superb. It definitely tasted like eating at your grandmothers. The potato salad was just like my Gma’s; finely diced with celery, celery seed, and a slight tang of mustard accompanied by a slight sweetness.  The collards are vegan hence no meat but were still delicious, tender, and flavorful. The drinks were delicious as well. The portion sizes were quite large with everyone having leftovers except for the lamb chops they were so delicious that my friend ate all of them.

Ben's Chili Bowl,4,"Had high expectations for the chili dog but was disappointed by the bun as it is the kind you can easily get from grocery store. The hotdog tasted great while the chili was pretty spicy! Overall i felt that this didnt live up to the hype. I prefer Dirt Dog for the roll and the softness of the whole item.

The winner was the banana pudding which was so creamy and yummy! It costs more than a hotdog bun though. The pricing is steep!

San Matteo,5,"Nestled in the heart of Petworth on Upshur, San Matteo, is a delightful Italian restaurant that exceeded all expectations. The wife and I have walked by here for a while and finally found time to do an impromptu date night. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy atmosphere that set the stage for a memorable dining experience. The attentive wait staff made us feel right at home, offering recommendations and ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. Unfortunately I didn’t the waitress’s name, but she was so nice!

The menu boasted a variety of classic Italian dishes, and we opted for the funghi pasta and bolognese, both of which were bursting with flavor and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The house red wine complemented our meal beautifully, and we couldn't resist indulging in the decadent tiramisu for dessert. I do have to warn you…their bread is dangerous. It’s so addictive and fluffy. I couldn’t stop eating it.

San Matteo is a must-visit for anyone craving some great Italian food in a cozy local family vibe. We really hope they take off and more people frequent this spot.

I called the restaurant to ask if they had an online list of allergens (they said they don’t) before I placed an order online or if they had an online link they could point me to since I didn’t trust any of the ones I found online were the official US Nando’s ones. On their website FAQs if you click on “Can I see your nutritional information?” it just takes you to the online menu.
One employee did not know what an “allergen” or “allergies” were and the manager “didn’t have time to go through the book” 🤡.

Spice,1,"Never been disappointed as I am today, been coming here for 5 years to support this business because I genuinely enjoyed the food. Today that changed when a new young staff served me what seems to be left over pieces of shredded  chicken. I ordered the brown stew chicken with rice and peas and cabbage. As the server was making my large plate I asked her not to give me broken pieces. She gave me two small portions of whole chicken and the rest of it was broken shredded chicken which amounted to one extra piece of it had not been broken, so I paid for three pieces of chicken for what should have been a large which usually includes about 5 good pieces. Then she literally gave me one scoop of cabbage that were over cooked and needless to say I’m highly disappointed for her service. The owner was there but she is not approachable as she never smiles and always seems to just want to get people in and out her business. I think I will no longer support places like this although in the past I have enjoyed their food today was just trash of food service and poor quality of food.

Ordered the spicy wings with the sauce on the side and the smell of the chicken by itself wasn't to pleasing and was completely unseasoned. However, it does pair well with the sauce once accompanied.

Ordered the shrimp and chicken fried rice also which was good. Note it is not Chinese fried rice so you won't get all the components such as mung bean sprouts and the rice is different.

The Monocle Restaurant,5,"Today, we were incredibly fortunate to visit a unique restaurant, Monocle, located on Capitol Hill. We initially chose it due to its proximity to our hotel, but it turned out to be a true ""Washingtonian gem."" Opened in 1960, this restaurant has been operated by the same family ever since. The menu is concise, which we believe highlights the culinary excellence presented in merely five dishes. We were in search of ""authentic American steaks from real American beef from real American cows."" What we received far exceeded our expectations. Both steaks we ordered were exquisitely prepared to perfection. We both agreed that these were the best steaks we've ever had the pleasure of eating in our lives. #Masterpiece

As if the meal itself wasn't enough, our server, Marinos Apostolopoulos, provided us with a genuine journey through the history of this establishment. We are deeply grateful!

Given its location near the Capitol, the restaurant has been visited by at least half of American politicians over the last 60 years, including Presidents Nixon, Kennedy, Bush, and Clinton. Celebrities like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, among other incredible individuals, have also frequented this place. The number of VIPs and their dedications displayed in their own photos hanging on every wall is truly astonishing.

One of the servers celebrated his 50th work anniversary here two months ago with a surprise party for 250 people, an event that was featured on the front page of the Washington Post, which we had the opportunity to read.

The place is beautiful, with incredibly friendly service and excellent food. The wonderful experiences we had will stay with us forever. It's worth traveling for moments like these.

We highly recommend it and would love to return someday.",2024-03-27T22:09:25.509Z,0,,17,FALSE,,,3 weeks ago,,Lunch,$100+,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbHVxaU5BEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND7J5NkUY09hN9BToj_s23MgWKFGQtiJyi9o18=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbp0-XqZJG3atn9s5nHl-rnPzi6zsma6BpdwYP=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn2kjGXJz9x3Uiadsd752xZ075kg_1ZAVtVrcj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDzPzHxGMHZf5NcmUiYP4Cia8r9k_uVCGfcb3s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQT8-sBCohl-oWze_VCMwxlcC3suPaVW9P6Snv=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,110197712560672559902,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9mAF1xYmABp2Bw1LzxtEv-P5fhUUm50drk8bx=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmBaBoAUwRf8M1z6AAnrhrAOufNlSbaEAw8x2j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTOOO40ENEwB_FlHP-W_wAE-UvpHlcPN7vc3Bb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5wNJwDhJ4SQO4SkJKhWLCkpoilSMxePJhpRnc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODZGLhLdEU7fP0N9dlazxelszWrHw0M-ZtDZlB=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUCVxnvqUb8aR9rRCJxZ7mmMRk7doArYxU4iKx=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa9kpqHTmm9gkJFfkvz__wyIMhgI5JxWGgPwp6=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3yT289EaLuDQ8h3mXPBg42TfJIh0q9315tNes=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,
The Monocle Restaurant,2,I would say this restaurant was spectacular in the past.  Now it has wait staff that are tired of loud tourists that dress in sweats and wear caps during dinner and laugh far too loud and only leave the Midwest every 5 years for a vacation.  The service was what I would call angry and when someone rips the menu out of your hand and is rude you know you are in for a ride.  After 15 min of not being served and threatening to leave you get service….well.  The food was good but I wonder why restaurants feel that everything needs spice.  Bisque was far too salty and too much chili for the crab.  Steak was good because we said don’t season it we will do it ourselves.  The building is old and interesting  but if you are a tourist go there if you are not a tourist and more discriminating you would know better not to go here for dinner anyway,2024-03-27T00:52:25.215Z,0,,11,FALSE,,,4 weeks ago,,,,,,3,3,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENnFiTjF3RRAB,,,,,,Google,,117107393146861666771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flat bread while good lacked ""something"". I'd recommend sprinkling some goat cheese and kalamata olives on the top for added flavor.  The meatballs were good enough, tuna poke nachos enjoyed by those who eat tuna poke, the pretzel loaf good as well.  Love the dipping bread that comes with the Hummus.

Why pay $14 for a glass of wine at the hotel bar when you can split a reasonable pinot grigio at $17/bottle? Their iced coffee was already refrigerated and they used ice cubes of coffee, so those never got watered down.
