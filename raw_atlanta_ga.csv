Backyard Grill Truck,2,"I am saddened that I have to give this restaurant a poor rating because the customer service was excellent. The young lady at the counter was very polite and professional. However, the rib sandwich that I ordered was absolutely terrible. The ribs were small they were dry and hard for the price that I paid $10.89. I got three very small bones. So the rating that I‚Äôm given is not for the customer service it is most definitely a rating of a 2 rating of 1 to 10 on the item and a 10 on the Customer service. This was my first time so I do plan to revisit to try one of the other items to give it a second chance.

3 wing breakfast: OK - comes with grits and eggs (scrambled), with choice of toast or biscuit. Eggs were light and fluffy but, grits were undercooked and very ""gritty"" along with 3 very small lightly seasoned wings.

Salmon: Horrible - appears to be a precooked frozen patty which was spicy and dry. Definitely not like any fried Salmon patty I've ever had.

Lucian Books and Wine,5,"I‚Äôve been here for lunch and dinner. Google restricts my review to one meal (at least for photos and menu items) but I‚Äôd love to share my experiences of both.

My latest visit was for lunch. This is one of the most underrated lunch experiences in Atlanta. The atmosphere is light, airy, casual but elevated/sophisticated. Menu seems unassuming but has some absolute knockouts. Service was also just really enjoyable; I‚Äôm not much of a conversationalist but had Caroline at the bar and ended up having one of the best restaurant chats in recent memory, and was guided through the menu for an awesome selection of the omelette, sticky toffee pudding, and coffee.

Dinners are more intimate, and a little hard to get a reservation so it‚Äôs been tough for my schedule. Unsure how a group reservation would go but can vouch for solo trips and dates, or close 1:1 catch ups. Despite the reservation struggles, I appreciate the smaller seating capacity and streamlined menu. I suppose I‚Äôd like more small bite options to pair with the wine because I always end up getting the Jam√≥n Ib√©rico and would like more meats, but that‚Äôs knit pick.

I‚Äôll end with a confirmation that the book store element is not a gimmick and not aesthetics only - the curation is so well done. I‚Äôve gotten 5 books as gifts and 2 for myself.

Really appreciate this spot. Atlanta could use more spaces like this that execute on the actual food experience as well as they do in the creativity and vibe.",2024-02-24T05:08:40.217Z,1,,6,FALSE,,,2 months ago,,Lunch,Somewhat difficult to find parking,$50‚Äì100,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkX3N5MnpnRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuviEFXJaNoKYLpewOHhEXnVSXG20ammNXxk6V=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8kpjLcbJiLHQMwN3RCGLouMPR1jqS0x-n0D5A=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU39Drb4qnK2CVjJHtTKdCmqI8odEvxOEMsJUi=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMts0VIkQQNYJdPgdfCx2F_qKpoqhG0F4CXsMkX=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,115710604493132347526,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcKFZlFqTBzsL3ZPEgS4JlRWCReQ1b6ROUkvyR=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEdZfelMXz5za38HmiL1Gtwaml_mrEd_wQsDbK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCBXasSswtrLeqiMIZrl2PkBjNxB74QgN2Diuu=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBUoFUw1Gr3tOeg6EiMPTFlJ7TXRxBi1Rfttrg=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My partner and I could easily hear each other talk. The service was great, and our server was very patient and knowledgeable about the whole menu. He also gave good recommendations.
The food was amazing. Best tofu I've had in years. The duck was great, and the corn fritters were good. All the fried foods were light, not greasy and heavy, and tasted like they used clean oil. The drinks were good, and reasonably priced.

Brush Sushi,5,"Had a wonderful experience here. We had 16 course omakase tasting, and added few additional pieces right before desserts. Every single course was beautiful and delicious. Especially the design of plates/objets went perfect with each piece. For some of them, I felt like I was looking an contemporary art! Chef was super professional(Sorry I forgot to ask your name, you were the best) and provided enough(but not too complicated) explanations for us.

For drinks, welcome drink was amazing lovely. Crafted cocktail was bit strong and too flavourful to me. Not balanced. I also ordered sake flights, which was the best choice. Portion of sake was not much, nor
little. Server explained/recommended each sake and told us which sake would go well for each dish. We told them we're celebrating PHD defense, and they put small congrats graduate decor for our dessert. Gift after the course was also quite impressive - a sweet treat and teabag. We had to wait about 20 minutes because other people came late, but I was not angry as the chef/server explained and apologized enough.

Brush Sushi,5,"Having tried thoroughly enjoyed our omakase experiences at Mujo and Hiyakawa we have been trying to find other similar experiences in Atlanta. I am happy to report that Brush's omakase did not disappoint. The service was outstanding. Both the servers and the chef spent generous amounts of time talking with us and making sure we had everything we needed/wanted.

We did the 16 course menu and it was the perfect amount a food and I would say it is a better value when compared to Mujo or Hiyakawa. I would say the atmosphere sits in between those two. Mujo having a very chill comfortable vibe and Hiyakawa being more like a museum and culinary course. At Brush you get a more chill vibe and can get as little or as much information you want to the meal. I would also say that Brush is much less overbearing on the rules than either Mujo and Hiyakawa which was very nice.

The quality of the fish and dishes were amazing. Brush has a unique rice and some unique presentations that the other places don't have. All things considered I think Brush my be the best overall place (accounting for price, comfort and experience).

The only draw back of the omakase experience for me is the the space in not an intimate as the other spots I have mentioned.

Once we sat down our server went over the drink pairing with us and we opted to let him choose for us throughout the dinner (excellent decision). The chef came out to greet us and immediately started preparing fresh wasabi and getting right into the meal.

The food was delicious. They have a unique sushi experience with dry aging the fish. We were able to compare fresh and dry aged of multiple types and then moved on to Nigiri (and wow this was my favorite part). Everything we ate was delicious and we left very satisfied and will be back.

Not only was our server a nightmare but the manager was as well. The table behind us was dealing with the same issues we were. I guess they only keep the servers who are terrible at their job.,2024-04-15T03:12:25.158Z,1,,3,FALSE,,,a week ago,,,,,,,,,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeDltVU9nEAE,,,,,Google,,102197084598581566907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pasha Restaurant and Bar,1,Horrible customer service.. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Atlanta for the weekend. We decided to try this place out for dinner. We pulled up to valet and asked where there a dress code. A guy came up to the car and informed us we could stay at least a hour and 10mins due to dress code. We came in and sit down. We noticed several guys with tennis shoes and tshirt on with basketball cap. The food had no flavor. The drinks was weak. The waitress was nice.

Babylon Cafe,1,"If you want over priced food go here. If you want overpriced drinks go here! After a night at the club we decided to keep the moment going. From the outside this place looks amazing however looks can be deceiving.  It‚Äôs 3:30 am on a Thursday night when I heard the lady said its $80 for entry (I actually chuckled and said to myself this is not Vegas ) however I was with a group who already had a section so I wasn‚Äôt worried about a price . The lady then claims that the  group inside already has the maximum amount of people in the section ( 4 ) and it will be extra for any additional people cool,  it was handled by the men we were with. Upon entry I was hit with a very foul smell, it literally smelled like sewage however once we went up into like this jungle blue area the smell was no more. Once we got to the section the drinks came and they were poured into Flask (I guess to prevent people from throwing the bottles idk why ) but heres the biggest red flag!  I could taste the alcohol and tell that this was not the brand actual liquor it‚Äôs fake version. I was actually shocked that such an established would try to deceive people . I guess they expect people to be too high to even notice lol but I was pissed although I wasn‚Äôt even the one paying. For  10 wings it cost $36 dollars the most I‚Äôve seen for wings since I‚Äôve to ATL .

Kurkuri Bhindi was perfect and excellent.

We requested some food without onion and garlic (I know some of you will üò±) My wife doesn‚Äôt eat them and we were given couple of choices and she picked Paneer Saag and Daal Tadka. They were both good.

Masal soda Limca and Chilli mango mojito were spot on.

Why 4/5 stars? Roomali Roti was little less warm, almost on cold side and that makes it not so pleasant. Otherwise, everything else was perfect.

Staff is always at their best, making sure the guests feels they are special and satisfied.

Pasta Vino,5,"This post was made solely for the sake of the desserts. Whoever you have back there in pastry are putting their hearts and souls into these sweets.

I enjoyed a pistachio cupcake, and my lover a tiramisu. I, upon biting into the middle of the cupcake, took a second to process whether or not this texture was real. The sponge was incredibly soft and fluffy, aerated and moist. The pistachio flavor was present, but subtle. Accompanied by what may have been the finest cream cheese icing I‚Äôve consumed in my life. Candied pistachio pieces scattered on top made for the finest delicacy I‚Äôve had in a while. Simple ‚Äî executed perfectly.

As for the tiramisu, I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve historically been a fan of them (too bitter), so my notes on them are notably less. My companion, upon first bite, immediately remarked that it was ‚Äúvery good‚Äù with the bite still in his mouth. I found it to be very soft and creamy, with a present but not too powerful taste of espresso. The ladyfingers were soft and crumbly; the whipped topping a cloud resting on my tongue. My only note is that the overall texture was very monotone. I think a crunchier ladyfinger would lend some liveliness to the dish.

But yes, phenomenal desserts that deserve a special review and shoutout! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2024-01-14T03:21:14.729Z,1,,3,FALSE,2024-01-14T20:22:23.286Z,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$20‚Äì30,Somewhat recommend,Delivery,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeHNHOXR3RRAB,,,,,Google,,110095430206681913526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pricci,1,"On 3/10/24 I ordered from Pricci through Uber Eats and received someone else‚Äôs food. My name was written correctly on the bag. However, what was inside and printed on the ticket wasn‚Äôt mine. I contacted Uber Eats with pictures and they reached out to the restaurant. Afterwards, I was told that I was ineligible for a refund. I then called Pricci and spoke to Andrew. He said I would have to settle the matter with Uber Eats. I tried contacting Uber Eats again and got the same response. On 3/16/24, I filed a dispute with my bank. As a result, Uber and Uber Eats won‚Äôt let me use my accounts until I satisfy the debt. Pricci should've took responsibility for their mistake but chose not to, causing my experience to be the absolute worst.

Pricci,5,"Update- Went to Pricci‚Äôs tonight for dinner for a return visit.

FABULOUS.

Had a calf liver starter with grits that was outstanding. The Fritto Misto was delicious- just the right amount of breading and lightly fried.  The veal chop was remarkable. It was perfect. My dinner guest had the pasta with shrimp, which was delicious, and the other guest had the cippino. The service was 5 star. Kudos to the
chef and the restaurant. I will definitely return.

Went to the restaurant tonight because I had a gift certificate. Five of us dined. I ordered the Veal Milanese, which left a lot to be desired.
My broccolini could have been better. Two others at the table ordered the Bronzino, and split it.  After telling the server, a manager came over,  the Chef came out to apologize for us not liking some of our entrees and allowed us to choose other entrees.  The lamb chops, which were a replacement,  were fabulous as were the truffle fries. The other dining companion had the pork chop which she said was delicious and another had the Chilean sea bass which was fully devoured.

Suffice to say, , but KUDOS to the restaurant for doing everything right to
take care of the issue.

The Chef was a joy and  the manager was very nice,

If you go, get the lamb, Chilean Sea Bass and pork chop.",2024-03-13T00:32:39.778Z,0,,26,FALSE,,,a month ago,,,,,,,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0c0kzakVBEAE,,,,,Google,,107945116872952987838,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La Grotta Ristorante,3,We visited La Grotta for the first time yesterday. I was looking forward to this restaurant for a very long time. I was disappointed. It's a noisy open space.  Not too cozy.

La Grotta Ristorante,1,"I enjoyed dinner with my boyfriend at this clean and authentic establishment. However, the food itself was subpar, I fine dine frequently, most recently going to Malio‚Äôs in Tampa Florida. The escargot there was lovely as well as the one here  at la Grotta. But the burrata cheese lacked flavor, and the bread was rustic but yet again lacked flavor. The olive oil was served without any herbs or seasoning, which is fine, but it didn‚Äôt taste like a cold pressed olive oil so I was confused on why it was served so basic. Their wine list is insanely huge, and you would assume that you could find something for everyone. Unfortunately for me I like champagne, and they only have 2-3 champagne‚Äôs they sell by the glass and they are all bitter. So I had to settle with a moscato that wasn‚Äôt that good. My partner doesn‚Äôt too much care for wines, he‚Äôs more of a whiskey drinker. Although the establishment was beautiful, and the food was authentic I‚Äôm very disappointed in the initial experience me and my boyfriend had to face. Given the amount of time this establishment has been around I expected to be experiencing something better than Flemings but the food didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations. My waiter was absolutely amazing and gave great suggestions for our meals and desserts. He was attentive, funny , and accommodating to all of our requests. I hope to return in the future and to be greeted with a better, more tasteful experience at La Grotta.",2024-04-04T22:28:17.007Z,0,,5,FALSE,,,2 weeks ago,,Dinner,,$100+,,Dine in,4,3,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaVBYM2F3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQfiUMOtPAv3cz82ECQpy6Yw_xz8a_eS05dFVU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiMFR4NobZRSUlryNBum3xfjyBagsKSddxgEqZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy3wfDs6Yy1wTEnM8rciVc8Qujczzy9_E1fGa5=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2ZYsMG4K7DCCydMeA3gAb4EMT2GRK7FgBg9io=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,114960732471120530246,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN4y6gVuLARK5BJLK6dI7uWUx7osN_ZsvXyac3=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvK3Eog3rvkdW0ak2zp4aPYdlrAS3nEMSa40Bo=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taqueria Del Sol,1,"Taqueria definition: a Mexican restaurant specializing in tacos.

As a mexican, I felt out of place at this taqueria because it is NOT AUTHENTIC. This is basically a locally owned On the Border / La Frontera Grill. The food isn't the worst but far from flavorful. Even the cashier said, ""Were a boring Taqueria""

My husband hates these types of places because they profit/benefit from the name 'Taqueria' when the flavor/authenticity isn't there. It's cultural appropriation, but I'm sure it's okay since some of the workers were Hispanic, and 1 co-Founder is Mexican. But the main guy is Mike Klank, a white American. It saddens me that Mr. Hernandez has accepted to Americanize our Mexican culture for financial gain. It's altered to fit the demographic they're looking for. The same thing is happening in Mexico. I understand that, but its not right. Its white-washed.

Health inspection was an 86 B.
No onions or cilantro on the tacos.
Tacos are made with flour tortillas, not corn.
No salsa bar.
Enchilada is $4 each, and it looked like vomit. The chicken it had was rotisserie chicken.
Canned beer was $5 each.
Guac was the only decent thing there.

We took the food to go, adding a 5% fee.
We went to El Rey del Taco right after for real Mexican food.

Teranga City Ultra Lounge,1,"They get NO STARS. Yesterday my friends and I decided to go there.for happy hour. After parking (in two separate cars) we were informed by a parking attendant (a young tall guy with locs) that it was TWENTY DOLLARS PER CAR TO PARK. We said nope we‚Äôre out. When we got in our cars another parking attendant pulled up and told it was TEN DOLLARS TO PARK. We still ended up pulling off and going to Botica which is ONE MINUTE AWAY where you can either park on the street FOR FREE or park in the parking garage where they VALIDATE YOUR PARKING (also FOR FREE). Bottom line, I‚Äôm sick of these black owned establishments in Atlanta ripping my people off over charging you for everything even before you enter. DO NOT GO HERE.

From the time we sat down, she had an issue. The service was so bad that I am not sure I will ever go back. I ordered to Chicken and waffles without knowing that there are jalape√±os on it. I can eat them but with the spicy syrup and peppers, it was overwhelmingly spicy. I am just getting over an abdominal infection so the spicy flavors were just too much. I explained it to the server we had and I promise you the entire staff was involved in the request to get it switched; the whispering; the stares; the passive/aggressive behaviors were so unprofessional and petty!!!  We sat on the patio and were able to watch the entire show that was going on all initiated by our server. The manager came out and while she was friendly, it was obvious the server had spread negativity to her as well. The manager resolved the issue with reflections.

It's different than all the other Planta locations in that the customer service is garbage. They treat you like it's a burden for them to serve you. They asked us where we would like to sit and we chose outside seating. 10, 15, 20 minutes go by and no server comes to get our orders (restaurant was not busy and severs were inside chatting). Almost half an hour later a lady comes out to tell us that ""the servers don't want to come outside bc they've pollen allergies""... after finishing our lunch inside we come out only to find out that there are multiple parties sitting outside and getting served, even have a photo as a proof. The same server who denied to come outside to serve us was the one serving others when we left. I've never been treated so badly at any restaurant let alone a Planta.

Food was ok, not bad at all,  but not amazing. Drinks were weak (if you're a drinker), really sweet. Taste good,  but kool-aid, in my opinion. Probably drink 5 and just have a buzz.

I gave it a 4 because I didn't like billing.
If you have 5 or more guests, they only give 1 bill. They will only allow up to 3 cards to be charged, you would have to tell the waitress how much on each card.  We ended up just calculating our own meals and drinks, then divided the $99 gratuity equally and sent the money to 1 person to pay. I didn't like that part. I guess it makes since on busy nights,  less confusing for staff and they make sure they get a bigger tip.

The Boiler Seafood Atlanta,2,"We visited The Boiler Seafood Atlanta on a Friday around 6:30 PM. Fortunately, our server was friendly and attentive. However, we were disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered nearly all the appetizers, but none of them tasted fresh. It was as if they had been prepackaged and came straight from the freezer. For our main course, we ordered lobster bites with fried rice, two different boiler bags, and two orders of Alfredo pasta. Unfortunately, everything in the boiler bags and the fried rice was overcooked, and even the potatoes had sprouted and tasted terrible. When we complained about the taste of one of the boiler bags, they said they couldn't make another one but offered us a free cup of sauce to mask the sour taste. The two orders of Alfredo pasta looked completely different from each other. In one, the sauce was extremely thick, making it almost impossible to pull apart. In the other, the sauce was very watery and resembled soup.

Although the alcoholic drinks we ordered were tasty, they lacked alcohol. If you prefer drinks that are not overly sweet, avoid ordering them. The atmosphere was okay, but it wasn't suitable for families due to the constant hookah smoke and loud music.

Carmel,2,"We arrived around 2:30.. didn‚Äôt put in food or drink orders until 2:50. It was maybe 10 people in the whole restaurant. So very unsure why service was awfullllllllly slow. We had the scallops app & a side of fruit (best thing we had there). Ordered the Carmel Old Fashioned‚Ä¶ meh. Also, ordered a mocktail.. yuck. From there, we ordered Hanger Steak & Tenders & fries for our daughter.. we didn‚Äôt recieve that until 3:45. Again, there‚Äôs 10 people in the restaurant. Everyone just moves around like they‚Äôre on edibles. It‚Äôs so underwhelming. I‚Äôve never had to ask for a Togo box before the food came & still ended up leaving the food because it was just bad. Hanger steak was lukewarm & the tenders were fried hard & sat under the heating lamp on expo for about 10 minutes. Such a waste of money.

Brix & Stones Pizzeria,2,"The restaurant was very clean.  I didn't smell any food being prepared when I walked in. (They may have just opened) The pizza on display looked very appetizing. I ordered the Philly and fries. The sandwich consisted of  meat and cheese(not sure what kind of cheese. It looked like it came from a can and was splatted on the sandwich: not melted). There were a few slivers of onions mixed in with the Steak-um meat. The fries were fresh and hot but they covered in black pepper (no salt).
I cannot speak on the pizza. But the Philly was not what I expected based on the advertisement.(Silly me) The portion was pretty small for the price $15.24.

They were that good. Seasoned so well. And OMG! The Strawberry Shortcake French Toast. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical. Thought it would be sugar overload, but it wasn't. All the flavors and ingredients complimented each other very well. Had to talk to the Manager Nina. She sat at the table with us as we shared our compliments and a few laughs.

Instead of compensating for food coming out at different times, putting sauce on chicken when asked to put it on the side, appetizer coming at the end they decided to charge us an up charge for Mac n cheese even though meal came with two sides one of which they were out of. Never told there was an up charge and stated we should have just got double greens. Excuse me!!! Never again. And don‚Äôt get me started on the  rookie cop they have in there.

Le Bilboquet,5,"We both felt back to Paris!

Oh, WOW: absolutely floored by everything. Phenomenal food, superb service, and romantic atmosphere.

Escargot was to die for, literally. Frites were delicious and the steak, you ask? Oh my God... it left me rethinking our frequency of visits to Fogo de Ch√£o, I kid you not.

Cocktails at the bar are a must, so arrive much earlier than your reservation (don't come without one!).

We loved it. Hands down our favorite place in Atlanta for ""food orgie"", pardon my French!

Grand China,1,"This was my first time and my last time dining here. Though to say that I ""dined"" is a gross understatement. Last night, I came here with my friends who had good things to say about this restaurant. We were greeted by the owner, who bragged about servicing Stevie Wonder, the Georgia Congressional Representatives, and all the positive reviews that her establishment has received. She even went so far as to say that her Egg Fu Young was highly rated by her New York customers. As a native New Yorker I was curious about the food. We were seated and placed our orders. Well, my dish was garnished with a hair smack dab in the middle of the plate. When I brought this to our server's attention, she was very apathetic and merely took the dish back. Her response made me scared to try anything else. So while my friends apparently had no issues with their food, I just sipped on the Coke that I ordered.

When it came time to pay the bill, she handed me mine with an attitude and let me know that she removed the dish from the bill, like she was doing me a big favor. Yet, she had no problem charging me $4.36 for a so, so glass of Coke. As we were leaving, the owner stopped us and asked if everything was okay, to which I responded no. She made no effort to find out why I was unhappy with my experience. She turned her attention back to the other party that entered the restaurant and proceeded to regale them with her stories. My friend, who witnessed the exchange, was appalled by her response. Rather than cause a scene, I decided to leave. I was already disgusted by the careless lack of cleanliness. I was even more turned off by how I was treated by the staff and the owner. While I understand that things happen, how you handle the situation speaks volumes. I got the message about this place loud and clear about the value they place on offering a clean and quality dining experience. Though it has received a lot of reviews for the food, I can't confirm or deny the quality of the food, but I can tell you that the service is of very poor quality. Something to think about if you're considering dining here.",2024-04-08T15:42:47.812Z,1,,2,FALSE,,,2 weeks ago,,,,,,,1,1,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaHVYNWRBEAE,,,,,Google,,103428079416498694517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Server took the order, and told us, she'll give us shared plates, we got appetizers, server was nowhere to be found again, the food runner dropped food and gave shared plates, server came back after 5 mins, and checked on firing entree. Then when entree came in, table was not bussed, food runner was holding plates, we cleaned our own tables. After that for 30 mins did not see server. Getting desserts was a task too as doughnuts take 30 mins to make fresh, it would have been nice if we had a heads up. For a simple meal, it took almost 2 hrs. Server was a sweet person but definitely needs little more training and manager needs to be little more confident.",2024-03-11T12:36:27.412Z,0,,82,TRUE,,,a month ago,,Dinner,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,4,4,2,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cjQ2ckRnEAE,,,,,Google,,113573902940354353496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cashier was very kind and polite. She took the time to answer questions for all the customers ordering and offered recommendations when inquired. We had a fairly big order, so the wait was approximately 25-30 minutes.

This was after we paid $50 to lyft here. After a while, we see someone walking pass and knock on the door. They let us in and advise us they‚Äôre not technically open yet but we ‚ÄúMay as well come in‚Äù. Chile whet?!?! Our server didn‚Äôt even acknowledge our reservations and told us to sit ‚Äúwherever‚Äù. The experience and service was beyond GHETTO. Our server had on house slippers and had 0 customer service skills! Atlanta‚Äôs WORST. My fianc√© and I ordered food and a lemon drop. We received the wrong drink.

This Is It! Southern Kitchen & Bar-B-Q,3,"A first timer since recent move to GA. This restaurant was highly recommended for soul food. I tried two different meals and while the food was to my liking the drive-thru conversation between the coworkers were awful.

I Love Wings,5,"Came here with a friend while we were in the area to check out Kroger. Webwere greeted warmly upon arrival, the place was clean, bright, and looked new which helped the place look inviting.

Their menu selection is VAST! I'm talking from wings, fries, to east asian food items like spring rolls,
noodles( fried and soup wise),  all present which was the first time I experienced a restaurant like that that was not a buffet( I'm from the east coast). I liked it!

My friend ordered lemon pepper (dry) with shrimp fried rice. I bought lemon pepper dry with french fries and my goodness th portions were plentiful for the price we paid which was such a plus in our book!
.we loved the lemon pepper as they were seasoned to perfection, yum! Friend said the fried rice was bland as it had little to no seasoning. The fries were good and crisp and came with some sort of sauce which I think is their homemade house sauce which taste like a mixture of Siracha, mayo and something else maybe mustard to give it a tang.

What other kind of gravy you have? She said we have other sauces. I said ma'am I didn't ask for sauce.  Sweet and sour chicken was delicious üòã.  But I'm not paying a Surcharge for using my card.

Creole Orleans,5,"This hidden gem is a must try!! The staff are very friendly and will be helpful if you need assistance navigating through all of the delicious options on the menu. The food is AMAZING! Literally everything is filled with flavor. The jerk turkey wings are my favorite with the perfectly cooked and seasoned rice and peas. All of the veggies are great. Not your typical spot where the protein is usually the star of the show and the sides are mediocre. Here, you get flavor in every single dish. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the greens, cabbage, green beans, &/or broccoli. The creole spaghetti is a hit too! The manager/owner of the spot was also kind enough to let me try the rasta pasta on the house recently and it was also delicious. You really can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu here‚Ä¶. And they are consistent! Ive eaten here many times and the flavors and great portions are sheets the same.
My only knock on this place is the location (inside the Greenbriar Mall) because I know they would be even more booming in a better location! This is a spot that truly deserves community support and I hope to see them outgrow the mall. In the meantime, they are still totally worth the trip inside (conveniently located near the food court entrance)!",2024-04-20T00:12:09.570Z,0,,7,FALSE,,,4 days ago,,Dinner,Plenty of parking,$10‚Äì20,Highly recommend,Take out,3,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaXZQQWVBEAE,,,,,Google,,112364487004244212264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Creole Orleans,1,"I'm so disappointed. üòñ I was starving and really had my mouth set on this food. It was so unseasoned I couldn't even enjoy eating it. The cabbage actually was unedible is the only flavor it had was apparently vinegar. Who plays vinegar and cabbage? As you can see by the photo there is absolutely no seasoning on it. It was just crunchy white vinegar cabbage ü§¢ The mac and cheese was just cheese noodles. No flavor whatsoever. The candy yams are actually okay But I mean, It's not hard to boil a sweet potato and add cinnamon and butter.

Ben Hill Grill LLC,5,"We were craving burgers and tried this spot for the first time. We got turkey cheeseburgers and LISTEN.. probably the best burger we‚Äôve had in Atlanta. It‚Äôs very simple, no frills burger. There‚Äôs nothing fancy about it. But, honestly, that‚Äôs what made it so good. The meat was seasoned well, and the condiments were the right amount. Only complaint was the fries were not crispy by the time we got home so next time we will ask them to poke a hole in the container to let out the steam. If you‚Äôre looking for a turkey burger that will taste like a house burger?

Farm Burger,1,"The food that I had today was not impressive at all. Some of the sweet potato fries were overcooked, the burger itself had no flavor which was rather odd, and the person that took my order behaved as if he didn't care when I was speaking to him. I appreciate you talking to me about it, but don't walk away when I'm still talking or interrupt me. The gentleman Ian knows a thing or two about service. Unless he's there, I will not come back nor and waste my time trying to support this business.

I'm not planning on coming back unless you all make sure the food is consistently delicious and the service is equally up to par. This is my second time coming here. I'm not sure if the rain is the cause or if you are short staffed or if it is a personal vendetta. There was hardly anyone in there - maybe 6 other people.

Also, the cookie that you sell are also shoddy as well. There's barely any flavor, it is far too thin and crumbly, and the price is egregious!
