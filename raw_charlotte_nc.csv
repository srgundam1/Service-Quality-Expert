Chick-fil-A,5,"I have been to this Chick-fil-A four or five times since it opened about four months ago, and the experience has improved each time! They have a mostly brand new staff that is still learning, but the extremely negative tone of the reviews shared here does not match the quality of experiences I‚Äôve had - The food was delicious, the staff was professional and attentive, the service was excellent and the store was clean!

As a former employee, I know Chick-fil-A has set the customer service bar high for its customers, and with this being a new location they certainly have room to grow in speed, accuracy and efficiency. However, to go a step further and demonize the community surrounding the store (as many reviews have done) is too far.

As you all know, Chick-fil-A traditionally operates stores in more affluent/middle class communities, and this particular store is located right on the boundary line between a high poverty neighborhood and a very affluent neighborhood in Charlotte. I can‚Äôt help but think this unique reality unfairly contributes to people‚Äôs perception of the store and its employees if the quality of service isn‚Äôt at the high standard they expect it to be.

In addition to providing great food and good service to customers, this store also provides over a hundred people with stable, high quality employment within walking distance of their homes. I‚Äôm not sure how many employees live in the community surrounding the store, but having employment options walkable to lower income residents is super rare in car-dependent cities like Charlotte, and it‚Äôs worth being excited about!

So don‚Äôt let these reviews keep you from giving this location a shot. Cut them some slack and give them some time to train their employees and develop them. And if the drive through line is long, park and walk in - 9 out of 10 times it‚Äôs faster anyway.

I went back to the counter and asked for a spoon.  She aggressively pointed to the dining area.  I told her that I don't want a spoon from the trash area.  She reluctantly gave me one from behind the counter.

The second visit was similar.  This time, I ordered.  She gave me a pen and receipt to sign for the purchase after, I used my credit card.

I ordered $200 of food tonight for my family, who have also eaten at Taipei Express for 20+ years and they noticed the drop in quality as well. What happened to the recipes??

I get to save my people-ing energy for the pick up window, and they are always nice, probably because they haven't had to go back and forth with me for my order! Everything is relaxed and easy.

There is something here for introverts and extroverts. Extroverts get to people at the pick up window, and introverts don't have to go through the horror of communicating their order to an actual person.

I am on the neurodivergent end of the introvert spectrum, so probably more of an extreme introvert.

CO,1,"****HAIR IN FOOD*******

Came to eat here After sending some stuff in the mail for my job
Was super hungry I ordered the crispy tuna of the small plates figuring it would come out first and the spicy garden bowl

I was excited when the crispy tuna came out only to be crust with disappointment and discussed to find a hair in my food.

Let my server know I sat next to the bar she was bartending all was well. She was a good waitress. Until I saw my bill after I paid and she charged me for the spicy tuna, she got me a new one, but I had to wait until my bowl came out to eat. I worked in the restaurant industry for several years and I would not let a Guest pay for something that they had to wait extra long for because they found a hair in their food‚Ä¶",2024-04-18T20:53:15.399Z,0,,3,FALSE,,,5 days ago,,Lunch,,,$30‚Äì50,,,5,1,4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbk9mUUFnEAE,,,,,Google,,108990877564006761341,,,,,,,,,,,

CO,3,"Atmosphere: 5
Food: 4
Service: 2.5

I was looking for a place to take my boyfriend for a celebration dinner, and this place had such a cool vibe on the pictures online and we love Asian food. The location is at a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking, and I promise the inside looks nicer than the outside. The inside is cool and modern, and the pictures of the lady on the wall look like my mom when she younger lol.

We came on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating indoor, and at the bar, but we opted for outdoor seating since it was so nice out. I also saw a sign for a great happy hour deal, so I'll have to come back one day.

Let's start with the food. We ordered the Golden roll, and the pork belly buns, and both were delicious! For my entree, I had a Thai noodle dish that was extremely flavorful, while my boyfriend got the Korean rice bowl, which was not bad but not quite to the standard of the other dishes in our opinion.

Our service was not fantastic and was the only downside of our meal. Although our server was ok, she was a little crass and borderline curt, something that I would expect from a local dive bar, but not a nicer place like this. At first I chalked it up to her being young and similar in age to us so she might have been more informal to be relatable, but at the end when we asked for the check, I wasn't sure if I had finished my meal enough to need a box. She said that she was either bring a box now or not coming back, which I thought was a little rude and out of nowhere. Of course she never came back to check on us after that either even though we were still dining for another 20 minutes. It was just a sour way to end an otherwise nice dinner for a special occasion.

I was also shocked and a little offended to see a 30% tip option. Tipping has gone out of control and the guilt of selecting a more reasonable tip amount puts customers in an uncomfortable place, especially when the service was not great.

I'd love to come back to try more of the menu because we had a nice experience in terms of the food and atmosphere, but I would hope to have a different server if I were to come back.",2024-04-16T02:12:33.521Z,0,,29,TRUE,,,a week ago,,,,,,,,5,4,3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENzRuTkFREAE,,,,,Google,,110270552234392068426,,,,,,,,,,,

Weekends are for brunch and make sure you listen to the specials!
Elizabeth, our server, was amazing: friendly, respectful, she know all the plates and made some recommendations and was always ready to answer any questions we had.
We ordered a custard filled French toast as an appetizer but instead of vanilla, it had a lemon custard that was delicious! It came with caramel walnut that were delicious: they even had a little salt on them.
I had the breakfast nachos that featured home made chips, two eggs, pico, guac, black beans, etc. I asked that they add bacon to the mix because bacon makes the world go round!
We also tried their crab Benedict's with pepper jelly on the side.

Hubee D's,5,"I found myself craving chicken that was both tasty and affordable before I take off for my New York City adventure tomorrow. A couple of months back, I was suggested to check out Hubee D‚Äôs in Meyers Park. I'm all about supporting local spots, so I decided to check it out. Walking in, I was warmly greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter‚Äîwho turned out to be Mark, the owner. We got chatting, and he shared that he's originally from Jersey and boldly claims his chicken could rival any in town. I admire his confidence and passion for his food! Mark, with his rich background in the restaurant industry, dreams of opening a northern-style deli/luncheonette/breakfast spot in the future.

Since this was my first visit, Mark suggested trying something from their menu of scratch-made chicken entrees, including tenders, nuggets, sandwiches, wings, salads, and wraps.

With so much to choose from, I settled on a fried chicken sandwich with pickles and their signature zesty Hubee Sauce‚Äîreminiscent of Zaxby's Chicken Sauce‚Äîalongside a serving of well-seasoned matchstick French fries and creamy mac & cheese with a white cheddar sauce. Everything was made to order, arriving hot and fresh. When comparing Hubee D‚Äôs fried chicken sandwich to that famous chain that's closed on Sundays, Hubee D‚Äôs takes the crown. The chicken was perfectly breaded and fried‚Äîjuicy and crispy. The Hubee sauce added just the right touch without being overpowering, and the bun was perfectly toasted, with the pickles providing a refreshing contrast.

While I usually lean towards baked mac & cheese, Hubee D‚Äôs saucy, creamy version was a delightful surprise.  So, if saucy mac & cheese is your thing, don't miss out on this one.
If you've driven past this local gem without stopping, make sure to bring the family next time. There‚Äôs something for everyone to enjoy! I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Hubee D‚Äôs!

P.S. Sorry for the half-eaten meal photo. I got caught up chatting with Mark and didn't want my food to cool down.",2024-03-30T01:39:10.873Z,0,,65,TRUE,,,3 weeks ago,,,,,,,,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENmRpZlp3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEOm38OWBbPNw9DNUYSXOqsdjglo5dfFsTa2dC=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-AYsLeLdoCsAtJ0VMxdIlXU0L97BoYCM139b9=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Google,,112695037750796027488,,,,,,,,,,,

Po Boy's Low Country Seafood,1,"My order was lost and food was horrible. Seems to be under new management. Worst experience ever.

I visited Po Boys on Freedom Drive on Friday, April 5th in Charlotte NC. This was my worst experience to-date. I have never been disappointed but I was this time. My food was cold, the corn seemed like it had been sitting and was hard to chew, the fish was small, didn't taste right and the light bread was hard. Oh...after I ordered online I arrived to find out my order was lost through Chow Now and had to wait another 30 minutes to get my order. Wait it gets better, then I'm told they're out of potatoes. I ended up trashing what I didn't taste because it was horrible. I guess all good things come to an end.

I‚Äôve tried the hot honey wings and spicy teriyaki and both were sauced well and unique in taste compared to other popular wing spots. Much better actually! Maybe made in-house? The sauce does not taste generic and the texture of the wings are always perfect. The prices and wait times are not bad either. There is a smoke shop attached with equally friendly and helpful staff. He took his time assisting me with my questions and went above and beyond to find answers if he was unsure.

We had a lovely lunch this past Monday and the outdoor dining area is fantastic!! We normally sit inside, but had our puppy with us and the outside was so pleasant.

Our food has always been top notch! We have tried many different dishes but come back to some of our favorites- this lunch was the max burger, dry rub wings and fries. All worthy contenders and perfect for a lunch!! I love the devil crab stuffed fish for dinner and my wife likes the bolognese. We have taken friends and none have ever been disappointed.

We have had some good servers and some just ok ones. Personally I love their tea and usually drink 3 glasses during the course of my meal. If my glass ever gets fully empty that is a red flag of poor performance in my opinion, unfortunately that has happened on most occasions.

To those about to dine, I salute you!",2024-04-07T21:14:50.647Z,0,,34,FALSE,2024-04-08T22:13:20.869Z,,2 weeks ago,,Lunch,,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,5,5,3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaXFPTWFBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXd2htU6Ah3l2OBFAWPpFiAmS-ODrux7BTnCgD=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAlz_wbDGGHYTku778bB4aS2F32jbugFpIM2iT=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Google,,111842877772253089745,,,,,,,,,,,

The Jimmy,1,"First time guests last night. Saw the recent negative reviews but decided to make my own assessment.
Turns out they‚Äôre accurate.

Service was sub-par. None of the staff looked like they even wanted to be there. Our server for some reason seemed irritated at what all of us ordered‚Ä¶why? Lol
The meatballs looked and tasted like they were frozen from a bag. The sauce was alright though.
Bread and ‚Äúgreat olive oil‚Äù was far from great.
The Caesar was dry, and had 1 little anchovy on it. Pizza was ok.
The cacio e Pepe was wayyyyy undercooked and the cheese clumped (cheap ingredients)
And all of it was definitely overpriced for the quality.
However, the octopus was probably some of the best I‚Äôve had in awhile.

When the order was finally handed to me I asked if he can check if the fries are hot or not and to replace them if they are cold. The employee got an attitude with me saying ‚Äòwe make sure the fries stay under the heat lamps‚Äô and I responded ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been standing here for 20 minutes and I can tell you that they were not under the heat lamps and sitting in the bag‚Äô
He then replied ‚Äòwell we are backed up and I can‚Äôt do anything about it, you can just go online and say something there‚Äô
Upon getting home the fries were NOT hot and the burgers were made so sloppily and packaged without care that the burgers fell apart after one bite making it almost impossible to finish.

Smashburger,5,"Service was over and beyond my expectations, the price was worth the quality of my meal, I was asked if everything was made to my satisfaction.
I felt everything was designed to meet desired food and dinning experience . This location surpassed the typical restaurant standard of service a customer would experience since the decline of the restaurant  industry as a whole post-covid, some of the staff members such as Jayden and Stephanie checked on me multiple times to ensure my order was correct and if there was anymore they could provide. This was my first visit to a smashburger and introduction to its menu or top notch service. I would recommend this location not only for its service and quality of food, but, most importantly, the cleanliness. Keep up the hard work. I will make sure to stop in anytime I'm in the area. This location will make it harder to want to waste my money on the contaminated slop the competition has to offer. The quality of food and service is a reflection of the pride the staff has for there establishment, which sadly is becomming a thing of the the past.

Brixx Wood Fired Pizza + Craft Bar,3,"Brixx is definitely a good way to go if you are craving a bit of everything.

Our drinks, appetizers, and food were delivered in a timely manner. Towards the middle of us bring there the dinner crowd did come rushing in which caused our waitress to I believe get fairly overwhelmed. We basically had to hunt her down for everything, straws, refills, cream, and sugar for coffee and even utensils. At one point, we just didn't feel like having to call her over or even wait any longer that we just decided to op out of ordering anything else and just leave. The food, though, was amazing as always.

Ru Ru's Tacos & Tequila,3,"Blanche Reynold's mansion holds significant historical value, much like many other establishments in the Myers Park area. The mansion features items imported from Cuba in the 1920s, adding to its cultural richness. Opting to park in the lot on Fenton Place rather than the one off Providence, especially the back parking lot, is advisable. The expansive patio offers a charming outdoor space, yet navigating the premises can be intricate, particularly when entering from the rear parking lot. Despite the establishment's reputation for its drinks and margaritas, the margarita experience fell short of expectations. It appears that my margarita (pitcher of Friend Zone) may have been non-alcoholic or contained minimal alcohol content. The perceived lack of value for the $42 expenditure is disappointing, as the drink resembled a mere juice consumption experience. I deeply regret not opting for the bottle of wine instead. The Billy Ray Valentine, however, proved to be exceptional. The enhanced queso dip, complimented by chorizo and sweet relish corn, was a culinary delight. The chicken fajitas (I'm Your Wingman), accompanied by cilantro lime rice, spring mix, queso, black beans, and sour cream, were a standout dish. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge in the tres leches dessert, but it undoubtedly would have been delightful. The service provided by Adrianna was exemplary! Notably, the establishment does not provide straws, so it is advisable to bring your own if needed.

The three amigos appetizer which has fresh tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa, and queso was good.

Mr 3s Crab Pot,4,"Hands down one of the best seafood spots in Charlotte! The quality of food here is way better than one of those Asian restaurants. Crablegs are bigger, signature butter sauce taste like it‚Äôs made with crack‚Ä¶. Haven‚Äôt had a rich butter sauce with seafood since seafood connection closed. Pricing is on point with the market and isn‚Äôt any cheaper or more expensive than other seafood restaurants. However, they do offer daily/ weekly specials which can be attractive if you are on a budget. I can see parking being an issue, but I can say I‚Äôve never experienced it- always in and out! I don‚Äôt care for showing my ID for my order, cashier really attempted to not give me my already paid for food without it, but the cook OK‚Äôd it as I am a regular weekly customer. The signage is clearly posted in the establishment, so they technically have legs to stand on with that rule, so just remember to have it if you order online. Overall, it‚Äôs a great establishment and I will continue to patronize.

Edit: I came back to say, although the food is good- the establishment obstacles to obtain the food is similar to the Olympics (just joking), but ordering can be challenging. So I already mentioned the ID requirement to pick up food you paid for already. Specials are advertised in the store, but you can only pay cash for it. So if you stop by and decide you want a special item along with something else, they make you produce 2 different forms of payment- card payment for menu items, then cash for the special items. No cash- you will denied the special or told to go get cash. There‚Äôs no phone orders availability, so if you want them while your on the road, be prepared to pull over, check to see if you have valid ID on you, then place the order online if the site is working (it froze on me twice trying to enter my payment method).

We moved to the bar side and received slightly better service but still no introduction, very few words, I had to assert myself to order anything before the server walked away. I imagine they‚Äôre probably missing out on plenty of revenue from no upselling and hardly any communication at all

Providence Road Sundries,3,Bar atmosphere and pretty low key place with tight parking and dangerous getting out of the lot.  $40 for two burgers - pretty pricey.  Clam chowder was not good.

Providence Road Sundries,4,"I got takeout for my family.  The person over was extremely nice and very helpful with my order.  When I got to the restaurant my food was packed and ready to go and the cashier was happy to add a drink for me.

The atmosphere when I entered was very in line with their sign saying they'd been open since 1933.  The lighting was perfect.  Everything was clean and I'd say half of your meal was the experience of eating there.

We got a burger with onion rings, chicken tenders with fries, and quesadillas with sweet potato fries, and two cheeseburger sliders.  The total was about $70.  So about $15 per meal and $10 for the sliders.  Which is pretty much in line with food from a restaurant these days.

I enjoyed my sweet potato fries.  I did need to add a little salt.  My quesadilla was enjoyable but not great.   I would ask for the salsa and sour cream to be separate because they were together. It also could have been crispier and had more than just cheese and chicken.  I did ask for chicken and steak but it was just chicken.

My mother-in-law enjoyed her cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and mushrooms.  She enjoyed her meal and ate her leftovers.

My husband got chicken tenders with fries.  The fries he called ok.  He didn't eat them all and didn't finish them later.  We did hear them up and they would have been better fresh I think.  There were a lot of tenders about six.  They were thin for restaurant tenders and my husband said they were over cooked.  He called them passable but did eat the rest later so they were edible.

We got onions that nobody ate.  They looked a little burnt.  The sliders were your common sliders they weren't anything special but they were cooked well.

I would recommend eating in because the food would have been better fresh and I think the restaurant's atmosphere would have made up for the ok food.",2024-01-21T05:52:36.682Z,0,,39,TRUE,,,3 months ago,,Lunch,Somewhat difficult to find parking,,$10‚Äì20,,Take out,5,3,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONHIzZ2J3EAE,,,,,Google,,115984336177204982436,,,,,,,,,,,

Ken Cooks (SoulFood Restaurant),5,"Mannnn what!!!! I lovedddd this place so much. I went a couple weeks ago, and it definitely felt like home. I got the fried salmon and wing combo, yams, macaroni and mashed potatoes. For the drink I got the Arnold Palmer and my boyfriend got the berry punch which I also got to try.  The macaroni was top tier let me say that. That is a MUST try. Really all of the sides are a must try. The fried salmon and wings paired with the hot sauce was nearly perfection. The drinks were also really good‚Äîsweet, but good. Portion sizes are very generous. Also one thing that really stood out to me‚Äî the chef was really sweet and personable!! She came up and addressed my boyfriend and I by our names (I don‚Äôt know how she remembered, I was pretty shocked when she did that lol) and asked if everything was okay and what we liked and didn‚Äôt like.

Bad Daddy's Burger Bar,3,"My first time trying this place. Let me say that the food was delish. My issue is that the staff were in the dining area having curse filled conversations like they were at home among friends. Not even a patron who drank too much but the staff. I found it unprofessional and a bit insulting that it didn't occur to them that I didn't want to hear b-words, f-bombs & other crude language while trying to enjoy my Fri after work much less their silly & inane conversation.

It was extremely off-putting so I'm unlikely to go back & other locations aren't convenient enough for me to want to drive there. I'm at a loss to understand why mgmt would allow them to stand around where patrons are & can easily overhear every word they're saying. I have to assume they're okay with it because clearly the person I assumed was the mgr as he stopped & asked about my food could see & hear too because they were right there. Then, there was the one who came from the kitchen and slouched across one of the seats while he talked on his cell. Yep could hear his convo too.

The burger & my server who was not part of the group congregated near me were great, but the atmosphere they created made my Fri afterwork outing quite unpleasant.",2024-04-10T16:38:35.740Z,0,,9,FALSE,,,2 weeks ago,,Dinner,,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,2,5,4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENGJiblhREAE,,,,,Google,,106773096743122305842,,,,,,,,,,,

I don‚Äôt have any more minutes of my break to go pick up a new order?
