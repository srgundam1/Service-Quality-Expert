Dame's Chicken & Waffles,1,"My friend and I went in on a Sunday for a quick, last minute brunch at 3pm. Hosts were great. Food was good. Our server, Valerie F., was not. Maybe she was ready to clock out, bad day, upset she was working on a Sunday... i'm not sure.

Valerie F. had the worst attitude taking our drink order, she was very impatient when taking our food order, she dropped the food off, and was never seen again. My friend went to the kitchen area to ask for a box and as he was walking back to the table, he overheard Valerie say, ""oh, he can come back here to get a box but not his check."" (Rude and uncalled for - considering she had not been back to our table to check on us at all). He turned right around, went back to Valerie , and asked for our check. For context, the restaurant closes at 4pm on Sundays. We paid (with the hostess by the way because Valerie did not come get our debit card) and were out of the doors at 4:05pm.

This was our first time visiting Dame's Chicken and Waffles in Cary and was extremely disappointed in the service and behavior of Valerie. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this location and spending time and money in an establishment that condones this kind of behavior.

Dames Chicken and Waffles corporate office, restaurant management, and/or God himself should have a conversation with Valerie and I pray she has the day she deserves.

Dame's Chicken & Waffles,2,"A Friendly Visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles

I had been eagerly anticipating my first visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles, so I arrived bright and early on a Sunday morning at 9:45 am, only to realize that they don't open until 10 am ‚Äì my bad for not double-checking the hours beforehand! But arriving early turned out to be a blessing, as a small line had already formed outside, and more folks were joining in anticipation of a delicious breakfast.

Once seated, I ordered a glass of water, coffee, and orange juice. However, my excitement dipped momentarily when I noticed some food crumbs in my water. Nonetheless, I decided to give the menu a good look, settling on a waffle with maple pecan-infused butter and the American breakfast.

The waffle, accompanied by its unique buttery topping, was decent, but not quite the flavor explosion I had hoped for. The American breakfast, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark either ‚Äì the turkey bacon was a tad bland, and the sausage patties seemed a bit overdone. But hey, the buttery grits were surprisingly tasty!

To my disappointment, the coffee arrived on the colder side and lacked the robust flavor I was expecting. Despite these minor setbacks, when the bill arrived, I couldn't help but feel it was a tad steep for the overall dining experience.

In the end, while my visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles didn't entirely live up to my expectations, I left with a hopeful outlook. I'm confident that with a bit of attention to cleanliness and perhaps some tweaks to the menu, this charming spot has the potential to provide an even more delightful dining experience for its future guests.",2024-04-07T15:27:10.494Z,0,,74,TRUE,,,2 weeks ago,,Breakfast,,$30‚Äì50,,Dine in,3,1,1,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHJPSTh3RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPsXpUSAhujVPcc9cQ-EQ7-86CHA4ZmMZppMQY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMonkks0XUqU13o5g5ay4Vx5pDOqAPoWrmHgvel=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEZLQGjEQGmI21nbq9Xu_DRw48GrBNScMrltlM=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Google,,100090625475780147863,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It‚Äôs one exit from PNC Arena so a great spot to stop pre and post any show.
There is a large patio with a projector for only the best games. Large yard games for everyone to enjoy. TV‚Äôs everywhere so you never miss a game or Chive TV lol. The beer selection has yet to disappoint as they cater to everyone. The food is fresh, supports local bakeries and has some of the best comfort food! Fish & Chips, burgers, wings and some delicious dishes on the menu. One of my favorite Cheesesteaks around. Highly suggested and can‚Äôt wait to see what else this place has to offer in the future :)",2024-03-08T04:08:07.630Z,0,,9,FALSE,2024-03-12T14:09:36.434Z,,a month ago,,Dinner,,$20‚Äì30,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5OWJHQm9RRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzSuRwt_RBNjewCu244da5wj9UrWNMicXDmidl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbrn3PWjCyOsYsTV1xqU08yu01_EH56F120Op2=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOccPLlFOkgZfQlK2N9_gI778RjAzBx6JsGOL-L=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Google,,107031260388635359670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New China Chinese Restaurant,2,"I've frequented New China several times, but my experiences have often been marred by unpleasant interactions with some of the female staff members. Their demeanor often comes across as rude, which has been consistently off-putting.

Moreover, their ordering system, where they require a complete order before handing over the food, seems inefficient and unnecessary. This process would make more sense if there was an option to pre-pay to ensure the order matches the right customer. However, as it stands, it feels like an extra, pointless step that adds to the overall frustration.

I've also noticed a concerning pattern that suggests possible racial bias in the way customers are treated. This has been a recurring issue in my visits, leading me to question the inclusivity and customer service approach of the restaurant.",2023-12-05T17:18:52.598Z,0,,2,FALSE,,,4 months ago,,Dinner,,$30‚Äì50,,Take out,1,4,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMUpTY1FnEAE,,,,,,Google,,101636574896974948162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herons,5,"WOW. Just wow. I should start by saying I am very picky. I am a chicken tender and california roll kind of girl. The courses I chose were the crab, scallop, duck, and chocolate. The crab was EXQUISITE. Who knew sea urchin custard would actually be good? The scallop was cooked to perfection, the duck was the perfect cut, and the passionfruit and chocolate combo was to die for. The small bites in between were amazing too- wonderful breads and the best corn dogs you could ask for! The service was amazing as well. Our fabulous server Casey explained everything in great detail and made sure we were well taken care of. The presentation of food and drink as well as the clearing of plates were so smooth and clearly well practiced. Each staff member I interacted with was full of knowledge and so amazing helping! Megan made the best hot chocolates, Carlos followed up with perfectly foamed and decorated lattes. Kacy, Rachel, Lizzie, Mari, Josie, Mike, and Tim were fantastic about clearing exactly on time and so incredibly kind in my brief interactions with them. Kalyn was a fantastic hostess and so incredibly accommodating. Another fantastic part of the evening was meeting the wonderful Chef Spencer! He and all of the other kitchen staff put SO much care and effort into making our dishes wonderful. The atmosphere was very cozy with lovely music playing just quiet enough for conversation but just loud enough to set an uplifting mood. I‚Äôm sure there are many other names I forgot to get, but truly the experience was wonderful and one I will never forget. Thank you to the amazing Heron‚Äôs staff for making my birthday so special! If you‚Äôre looking for a place to have the *perfect* fine-dining experience, Herons is definitely the way to go.",2024-02-22T06:00:56.452Z,0,,23,FALSE,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURka3NpeG53RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1pWuZsYe_iINAeGy5XBl0utEPKYgx1Z-wBx1q=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMaXftQBDPvAUAPGXs1Yzytz87g-G-4yvsc44O=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPujFD6-WRcvDmC4A-s8UNMp1f7EOxb69CsWV_=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz1xKsOrfurB_ZjmNFclowAMBVSncaP9sXAgbk=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjc3z6l3fEqJUJSaS38mSFH58X1cccjqqpgHDK=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,104899738631109308089,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS4oi41VyF_2ia_m3kpjqwTKnwEhDhkIETVbHB=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzIoRIDqK7bSxq4sUaxSlneJdbKSkYAdABrSmi=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHExzeeDHu38rE_JyibQ5POvM3hVINuJ9-JrlZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR2oYsm201U2tYbMWYDi5xrsaTgOz-GDZvML58=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,
Herons,5,"We were lucky enough to have our anniversary celebration dinner at Herons last night. OMG, what an outstanding experience! As others have stated, the service was impeccable yet very personable and down to earth. And that statement applies to everyone with whom we came into contact.

The place was beautifully decorated but not the least bit overbearing. And the atmosphere was quiet yet celebratory throughout the restaurant. Clearly everyone there was happy.

And for the food.... I can't begin to describe the complexity of flavors. Every course was unique and delightful. We chose the wine pairing option; it was every bit as delicious and harmonious as the food creations. The Sommelier knew his trade, providing outstanding selections that complimented every course.

We're so happy to have chosen Herons for our celebration.",2024-02-18T16:43:25.482Z,0,,29,FALSE,,,2 months ago,,,,,,,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkdThMYmpRRRAB,,,,,,Google,,104173644955983015616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ruth's Chris Steak House,1,"We have been long time customers of this location. We even hold our annual company Christmas parties at Ruth's. However, last night we wanted to have a nice meal, but had a time limitation, due to friend leaving on a flight. We decided to get our meal ""to go"" so that we had some schedule control. We ordered on 4-11-24 at 4:30 pm online with a 6:30 pick up. When we arrived no one new anything about our order. The server at the bar was extremely friendly, apologetic and was helpful, but returned without the order. We showed the receipt and she agreed that all was in order. The server said they would get ""right on it"" and  would have our order soon. At nearly 7, she brought out the order.
On the way out, we asked to speak to the manager. Surprisingly, he was aware of the situation, but did not seek us out. Whether intentional or not, he came across as aloof and unconcerned. He said that there was little he could do since we had paid for the meal online. He said that they didn't know their ""tablet"" wasn't working and they didn't receive the order, so.......

In an upscale dining establishment like Ruth's and particularly since we have been long time customers, we would anticipate a better experience. Frankly, we would have rated the service 0-1 if not for the server that helped us at the bar.

Also, my wine was good (Vietti). If we try Ruth Chris again it will be in North Hills. This one was a huge disappointment when I was craving a flavorful steak.

Our server was good and attentive. There were two managers that walked around checking on guests and seemed engaged, however, one of them was selective in who he approached.

Ruth's Chris Steak House,2,"I‚Äôm not even a picky eater (and I was very hungry) so I‚Äôd have eaten even a mediocre meal and enjoyed it at that point - but I still had to send back a few items.

The calamari tasted like soggy batter, probably the worst calamari I‚Äôve had.

My steak had far too much butter. It was drowning in it to where the steak tasted awful.

When I mentioned to the manger they just argued with me and then picked it up and walked off.

I didn‚Äôt know if they were making a new one, or refunding me and not bringing a new one, or what - until server explained what the plan was.

I don‚Äôt want to only point out negatives always try to be balanced - our server was nice and honest, the wine was quite good, and so was the desert.

That said, for what it costs they really do need to work on how they prepare some dishes to be more consistent- and they need a manager who can communicate effectively or arms who actually cares about having standards.

Bonefish Grill,1,First I want to commend the front of house staff and everyone that had a hand in the brunch event today it was great food and wonderful people. The reason for the one star review is the owner or manager Brian. What an absolute horrible experience. From cutting off your own staff while we are in the middle of being seated. Talking down to them. Not listening to a word we said about being for the event. Sitting us in the wrong section and not letting anyone know we were there at all. When we finally got up and asked about maybe getting some water after 20 minutes he informed us that there was a process to the event and we needed to be patient. Meanwhile in the room the event was going on they were already on their second drinks and appetizers. The entire time he spoke down to us like we were an inconvenience to be at his restaurant. Watching him interact with other guest and his staff I couldn‚Äôt believe how he was.

Bonefish Grill,2,Went in for lunch today. The waiter we had was great however it took forever to get out food. The waiter ended up comping our drinks due to the long wait for food. I‚Äôm talking over 40mins for a Caesar salad and steak with shrimp. I could understand a longer wait time if the place was busy or even half full but there was very few patrons.  My wife ordered the filet medium however when it was brought to the table it was cooked well past well done. You could tell whoever made it was not very experienced in cooking steaks . I will say the appetizers and drinks we had were good however  we will not be back to this location.,2024-04-15T01:10:35.673Z,0,,8,FALSE,2024-04-15T07:02:27.466Z,,a week ago,,,,,,,4,2,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaDlfUDVnRRAB,,,,,,Google,,115885354570195757155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bonefish Grill,1,"My grandparents made a reservation for brunch on 4/14. We were greeted by a sweet hostess but then was soon bombarded by another employee, who we soon found out was one of the managers, Brian. Pushy, unprofessional, insulting manager. Was talking down to his staff as if they‚Äôre all idiots.
I could go in detail about what else he did during the entire time we were there (because there was a lot) but what really set me off is when he gave my grandparents and my fianc√© and I check, while trying to walk away, he told us to basically learn how to make a reservation better next time. My fianc√© stopped him from leaving and asked him to repeat himself and the manager stated because my sweet grandfather called to make our reservation and did not use their website, that‚Äôs why they weren‚Äôt aware we were there for the brunch event.

McDonald's,1,"Line was not long but the wait was crazy...she took care of the 3 cars before me when it was my turn I sat for a couple minutes..she then started to take care of the car that pulled up next to me but was putting his order on my screen.  We were trying to tell her what was happening and she snapped at the other car and then snapped at me when taking my order.  I was not rude chalked it up to a bad day.
Got my order and the drink size was wrong, the guy was nice and was making it right.  When I went to get my drink it was a girl handing me the drink, I am in a very low sports car and it was 9pm, she was handing it to me carefully which I thought was odd but when I went to place it in my cup holder realized there was no lid as it spilled all over me and my dash board.  When I turned around the guy was back in the window horrified handing me napkins and the lid saying he was sorry!  The girl was walking off...the guy said something to her and when she spoke I recognized her voice as the one taking my order.  Called and chatted with a shift manager that was nice and was wanting me to speak to the manager cause he stated this has happened before.  Manager has yet to call back and it has been a week. I have never had this kind of service here before but I will not be going back and I have made calls to escalate this with McDonald's.

Tribeca Tavern,3,I ordered the buffalo wings and the sweet wings from the appetizer menu. The wings were not bad. They were actually pretty tasty. I prefer the sweeter Wings because it had more flavor to it. Not bad for wings and not the best I've had. I ordered a dirty martini which was okay. And I ordered the bison meatloaf for dinner. The bison meatloaf had a lot of burnt edges and corners on it. I wish they had not grilled it so hard. It wasn't bad and it wasn't the best either. However I did love the mushroom Demi. That was delicious to eat with sea meatloaf and especially in the mashed potatoes. I thoroughly enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the mushroom Demi. That was delicious. The Ambiance is very nice.

Sophie's Grill And Bar,5,"My boyfriend and I dined here a few weeks ago for a date night and we were very impressed. We were both craving Eastern European food and Sophie's exceeded our expectations. The owner is from Bulgaria and has a lot of unique food and drinks on her menu.

We were able to make reservations and we asked for a booth. There are lots of fresh flowers and plants decorating this restaurant. We loved the vibes and definitely felt like we were transported to a restaurant in Europe. I started with a bourbon drink called the Boulevardier with Campari and it was delicious. My boyfriend had a bourbon. We ordered the Armenian figs appetizer, and my only complaint is the bacon was barely cooked. That is on me though because I should have specified we like our bacon well done.

For our entrees my boyfriend had the Balkan's wine kebab and I had the stuffed cabbage rolls. My entree was really good, but next time I'm ordering the wine kebab. The flavors were amazing! It consisted of slow roasted chicken, veggies and rice. The bartender was our server and she was wonderful.

Fang's kitchen,3,"I've been coming to this place now and then since they opened this restaurant because it's close to my house. This is not the one of best szechuan restaurants although I have not found one in NC yet like ones in CA or NY. However, better than or similar to szechuan garden or chengdu 7 in my opinion.

I only had limited number of dishes so far, but here are what I recommend and not recommend:

Not recommend
- General Tso's chicken, it is not typical general tso dish. They use ketchup or tomato based sauce and not spicy at all. Also wish they cut the meat into smaller pieces.

- Kungpao chicken, same reason above

- Beef string bean with garlic sauce, expected clean garlic based sauce, but it had the same flavor of General Tso. Disappointed.

- Lo Mein or Chow Fun, any noodle based dish, they way overcook noodles, so noodles become too mushy and stuck together (see photo)

- Any fried rice, just not good.

- Mushu (Pork) - Super sweet and very little meat, mostly cabbage, wish they use shredded fresh cooked pork, not precooked dry bbq pork (see photo)

Recommend
- Chongqing diced chicken, not the best I've had but pretty good, it is fried (see photo)

- Salt and pepper spare rib, good but it is also fried (see photo)

The young lady at the register was very nice. She gave me a friendly greeting and energeticly took my order.  I haven't dined in at a CFA in years so I don't know if this is standard but after I ordered she gave me a stand to put on my table and they brought my food to me quickly.

I will say that some of the tables were not clean when I looked for a place to sit. It wasn't a big deal because there were some clean tables available. I also couldn't find napkins. In other stores there is a place where there are napkins, straws and condiments. I looked around but could not find it here.

Enrigo Italian Bistro,1,"We have eaten here many times since it opened. We had guests in from out of town and it was a perfect place to meet. Mason our server was the only good thing about the night. Our Caesar salad had absolutely no taste at all. Followed by a chicken parm that was pounded so thin and fried we had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. At $26for chicken parm I do not think it was even an entire chicken breast. There was nothing moist or juicy in this entree at all. Also ordered was a maybe 2 inch by 3 inch piece of eggplant parm for $24. The veggies it came with were good. Clearly the portions have gone down and the prices have gone up. Our guests did not finish their food and I believe were just being polite in not saying it was not good. To top it off on the bill they added a non cash adjustment for using a credit card!!

Enrigo Italian Bistro,5,Honestly I don't even know where to start. There aren't enough wonderful words to describe this authentic Italian restaurant. My husband and I love traveling and trying different cuisines and restaurants. I have to say in all my life I have never been to a place where I was more impressed with the staff than anything else. Don't get me wrong the food was AMAZING but the staff were so warm and welcoming. We truly felt like we were part of the family. I seriously thought they seated us and mistook us for a different family with a reservation because of how accommodating and attentive they were. We live 4 hours away but will absolutely be returning every time we are in the area! I've already told others about this wonderful place and they are looking forward to going.

First China Restaurant,2,"Tried this place because of the good reviews. LIES!!! Ordered General Tso's chicken and requested it to be extra extra spicy. Food was barely warm, had ZERO spice and pretty much no flavor except for being overly sweet. The ""meat"" was mostly batter, chewy and tasted of old oil. Did they try to re-fry old chicken or was their oil just overdue for a change? I don't know, but the food was not good at all. I had to toss it. Pork eggroll was a little more edible, but soft and on the chewy side.  It did not smell of old oil like the General Tso's, but maybe the eggroll was old too?

The waiter showed no care about our meal. I will not say what I saw in the bathroom. That was absolutely disgusting. It truly was sad how they showed no care in our experience.  If they showed care about it. We would chalk up as off day. It could been handled so differently. I have spent well Over 24 years in customer service. Then to boot we got home and realized there was 9.90 tip when we said no tip on the screen. We were told it was our mistake. To end it If you try it best of luck. I will NEVER visit this reasturant again.  This is absolutely awful service.  Truly disappointed how everything was handled.

Orient Garden,5,"Orient Garden is truly the best Chinese take out restaurant I‚Äôve been to.

It is crispy, the chicken is good quality, and you can actually taste the sesame flavor. The fried rice is always very fluffy and fresh.
My only suggestion would be to add sides of the veggies. Such as a half size of the vegetarian delight or broccoli in brown sauce.

Char-Grill,5,"For the longest time I thought their food was good, but overpriced. I never really went often due to the closest location being about 25 minutes from me. However, with fast food costing what it does today, this is a much better value. It's about $12 for their half pound steak burger combo when you add cheese. That's pretty much what you're going to pay for a similar sized meal at a fast food place. I'd rather come here every time given the choice. Service was excellent the last time I was at this location, with the guy at the register being so friendly and helpful with refills, extra ketchup, and asking how my day was going. Tons of toppings to choose for free, but I wish they'd use whole leaf lettuce instead of chopped pieces. Minor complaint. The fries and simple but fresh, crispy, and well salted.

La Cocina Mexican Restaurant Cary,5,"My husband and I came to North Carolina from Pennsylvania for a friend's wedding. Our hotel was near and my husband decided to surprise me with lunch. I had no idea where we were going, we just knew we were starving. To my absolute delight he brings me here to La Cocina!!! This establishment has such a cozy, relaxed atmosphere and I loved that they were playing good old fashioned Spanish music that I was super familiar with and was able to sing along with and dance in my seat to, as I enjoyed my meal. There was a very small ""lunch crowd"" I guess you could call it but, not rowdy or anything of the sort thankfully. Now to the SERVICE! Our server was Alex (Alejandro actually but I guess he uses Alex for the job). This gentleman is an absolute GEM!!! From the moment he introduced himself and took our drink orders, his demeanor was wonderful. He gave awesome, detailed recommendations about the variety of sangria's and drinks that they served. I went with his recommendations! lol When he brought us our drinks, he asked if we were ready to order and I proceeded to ask him about the menu since it was my first time ever visiting. He was so detailed and took his time explaining as well as recommending a variety of items to try. My husband ordered the Tender Ribeye and I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas. They served you tortilla chips and homemade salsa as you wait for your food. Without a doubt, their house salsa is one of, if not THE best salsa both my husband and I have ever had! We told Alex how much we enjoyed it and I didn't realize it at the time but, he took note of it! (keep this in mind for later). Now, my mother back in Pa has been looking for a place that makes authentic tamales and unfortunately, we can't find anywhere back home in PA. As luck would have it, what happened to be on the menu???? You guessed it...TAMALES! lol So I told Alex about my mom's predicament with her sooooo desired tamales and told him that I would like to try one to see if I liked it, so as to bring some back to my mom. He jotted down an order for 1 along with the rest of our food and went away to the kitchen. When he comes back, this wonderful gentleman came back with not 1 but 2 tamales, each made differently, so that I may try them and decide which one to take back home. He was super attentive, truly cared about whether or not we were enjoying the food and that we had everything that we needed as well as talking with us as if we were old friends catching up after a long time. All that along with never missing a beat with his other tables! Needless to say my husband and I enjoyed our experience here in every aspect. I ended up ordering a dozen tamales to take back home lol. I thanked Alex for absolutely everything and especially for making my first ever Mexican restaurant experience in North Carolina such a wonderful one. OH, and we also took a huge container of that delicious salsa of theirs back home too! LOL! If you want a great dining experience that will make your taste buds dance, and an even more awesome dining experience because of such amazing quality servers, then definitely come here to La Cocina! My husband and I cannot wait to come back on vacation next year and eat here again!",2024-03-28T01:27:13.759Z,0,,6,TRUE,,,3 weeks ago,,Brunch,Plenty of parking,$10‚Äì20,,Dine in,5,5,5,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMXRYeGRnEAE,,,,,,Google,,117527383628310158229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subway,1,"Came to subway yesterday. An asian kid was behind the counter. This guy all of a sudden says, ‚Äúwould you like to box with me for a free sandwich‚Äù, made a boxing gesture to me, and then proceeded to say ‚Äúwe dont condone violence over here‚Äù confidently. It left me in a shock and i snubbed him.

What kind of lunatic hires this subway is making here? Why are you hiring psychos? If this guy is saying that we dont condone violence over here, Is this something that the owner has given guidelines or turned a blind eye to? This was the weirdest experience that I have ever had. You come to eat a meal and some purposeless rando asks you to fight with them.

To this kid, give yourself 10 years, when your male hormones will subside, I would love to check with you if you still want to fight with random strangers and go bankrupt paying settlements.

Btw if the owner doesnt apologize for this, I am going to send the email up the subway mgmt chain. Lets see now how much would this rando cashier would like to box with future customers.
