Chelan Cafe,5,"Well my friends, here's a great place to have a bite; breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
We stopped in for breakfast, and the ladies were inviting and held great breakfast conversations. Didn't really expect much but I found a nice little corner to have a quality breakfast and a chance to be silly in the morning.
The traffic wasn't bad but this place is located near the industrial area of the Port of Seattle so there's some big trucks in the morning.
I still really enjoy the restaurant, nice job Chelan Cafe.
Oh and by the way this place has no ties to Lake Chelan WA.

Volunteer Park Cafe & Pantry,1,"While the staff at this establishment continue to provide excellent service and food quality, I must mention the deplorable behavior of owner Ericka Burke. Never before have I witnessed such callous, selfish, and reckless actions. When a neighborhood plumbing renovation brought raw sewage water into the restaurant's pipes, Miss Burke demanded to keep the restaurant open even after her staff closed for the day in order to protect customers from serious illness. The implications of her irresponsible wishes in this situation are staggering. This woman should not be allowed to serve food to the public, since she is clearly more concerned with making money than with providing her customers safe food.

Perhaps more repugnant even than allowing raw sewage into her food, is the manner in which Miss Burke treats her staff. I have frequently seen her yell at her serving and cook staff in front of customers, even using profanities with children in the restaurant. In spite of her ridiculously unprofessional behavior, Volunteer Park Cafe's competant staff remains loyal to the local customers who have come to love VPC's family-friendly atmosphere, which is strongly bolstered by baker and co-owner Heather Earnhardt. It is clear to all who visit this restaurant that it is only Heather's efforts and constant presence that keep VPC running smoothly.

Ericka Burke should be ashamed of herself. She obviously wants only to make a name for herself by stepping on the backs of the people below her. Bouncing checks to her food purveyors, failing to pay her employees on time if at all, and providing false information to unemployment services are among some of her frequent improprieties.

I can only trust that some day, her wickedness will come back ten-fold, as it so often does with people as self-serving, greedy, and malicious as this woman.",2009-05-21T05:41:40.078Z,1,,1,FALSE,,,14 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROWNQck5BEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,102701116094024535447,,,,

Cafe Flora,5,"I visited Cafe Flora based on a friend’s recommendation, and it surpassed expectations. I love trying quirky/creative vegetarian and vegan restaurants, and this one definitely fit the bill!

We called ahead (30 min) since we were a larger party of 8, and they had the table ready when we got there, even though they don’t take reservations. The table location wasn’t ideal since it was by the door to their outdoor seating area and there was a frequent cold breeze, but thoughtful nonetheless. Our waiter was super friendly, which made our experience even more memorable.

We ordered nearly the entire menu and shared everything family style. My favorites were the brussel sprouts, coconut tofu lettuce wraps, eggplant & bell pepper campanelle, and turkish cauliflower polenta. The flavor profile for each of these was pretty complex and balanced.

A few of us got drinks - the mulled wine, wakey wakey, and rosemary lemon drop - which were all pretty delicious and strong. We ended the night with dessert, which were yummy but not neccesarily something to write home about.

Cafe Flora,1,"Cafe Flora is an institution in Seattle.  One of the first major vegetrian restaurants in the city.  But it has outgrown its pioneering reputation as it has expanded its footprint with a new restaurant and bakery in SeaTac.

Our party of five waited 20 minutes for a table.  Then we waited another 30 minutes before anyone took our order, then once we gave the order we waited another 20 minutes for our food.  Meanwhile our teenage daughter was desperately hungry. When my wife went to the wait staff inquiring when our food would be staff, a waitress said she would ""check.""

Once the food arrived it was ordinary.  Well and beautifully plated.  But it was generally bland and boring.

I don't blame the wait staff.  Clearly management of the restaurant has left it understaffed.  Our waitress was taking care of 15 tables in our room and disappeared for long periods. Perhaps serving even more tables elsewhere.  A totally unpleasant experience.  Oh and did I say it was my wife's birthday??

Cafe Flora,3,"Going to Cafe Flora used to be my favorite part of being in Seattle. I was glad that they had kept their mouthwatering coconut cake as they continued to innovate, but over the years it went from being a soft cake with tons of coconut in it and subtle undertones of intricate flavors, to being a super dry cake that's overly sweet and just tastes like frosting. It seems that they've changed recipes, or simply stopped putting in the work that they used to. The restaurant is too expensive for what it is now. Their burger also used to be better, I still love the fries though. They don't have enough vegan options considering what is now doable with vegan food. 20 years ago they were surely the best vegetarian restaurant in Seattle, but they need to catch up now. It was a dollar to add vegan mozzarella to the burger, and it tasted like Daiya. Dairy cheese was cheaper to add, so they tax vegans here. Even if it wasn't Daiya, it sure did taste the same. I was expecting something unique from somewhere that brands themselves as a tad bit ""finer"" of dining ($$$). Plating is nice.

Cafe Flora,5,"I found Cafe Flora on HappyCow, which is an app that helps vegans and vegetarians find restaurant options in their area. I'm glad to say that this place definitely didn't disappoint.

As a vegan it can be super difficult to find good restaurant options so every time I find one I feel like I've struck gold. Even though this place isn't entirely vegan, there are enough options that it'll make most vegans very happy. I ordered the Saffron and Lobster Mushroom Risotto and the Madison cocktail.

The Risotto consisted of arborio rice, saffron, and lobster mushrooms among other ingredients. It didn't taste overly indulgent or heavily sweet or savory, rather it just had a very complimentary combination of flavors and a great texture which didn't warrant extra sugar or salt. I love it when menu items don't taste overly greasy or rich and they have a cleaner vibe about them. The Risotto was accompanied with a minimalist Arugula salad with a great lemon vinaigrette. So simple, yet clean. Good dishes don't need a million ingredients, just a handful of quality ones.

The Madison cocktail seemed like a modified Manhattan, using an earl grey infused vermouth rather than a traditional Italian vermouth in a Manhattan. Honestly, I'm not super educated with my liquors so I cannot speak too much to the complexity of the cocktail, but I can tell you that I really enjoyed it.

My favorite main dish was the Octopus, which was so soft and not rubbery at all! My favorite vegetable dish was the Spinach. The pine nuts and raisins pair so well with the natural bitterness of the spinach. We ordered 2 desserts, both of which were delicious, but if I had to pick just one to recommend, it’d be the Flan de Cafe. Everything we ordered (besides the bread) was gluten free, including the chocolate torte (flourless!). Great atmosphere and spectacular service!

The welcoming staff were friendly and offered to come find us when a table was ready so that we could peruse the record store in search of artistic gems. The combination of the record store and cafe is an excellent idea, however, a little more attention to the quality of a few select dishes, rather than offering a long listed of similar dishes, would help to elevate the status of the cafe among local foodies.

Wonder Ethiopian Restaurant Sport Bar,2,"Update:
I’d say quality has gone down in the last two years they roll their injera and don’t put the platter for on the injera they place everything separate its like they’ve changed for the white population, injera is not the same and shiro quality has went down their portions are small as well. I really like this place as they offer alcohol and live music but I can say it’s no longer worth the hype. You can see the reviewed pictures of how the platters are placed on different plates when that’s not how it’s supposed to be served at all

They’re priced a bit high for a new place, however their food is good, portions are a hit or miss. Sometimes they give you a decent portion other times they hide everything with injera and barely put any sauce in so I suggest checking before you leave. Their injera is good but their teff injera is okay. The restaurants atmosphere seems like they want to make it welcoming to Americans, which is good in Seattle. But their food also does not always seem authentic because of that, like they purposely make it less spicy. But they offer deli every and takeout later than any Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle so just by that they’re up points. Always friendly though and one of the few Ethiopian sports bars in Seattle that make it seem like they want everyone there (not my atmosphere I prefer Ethiopian/ Eritrean only) but hey in Seattle if you want your business to survive you adapt and I can respect that. I believe their chef is East African although I could not tell, she looked a bit Hispanic but she makes good food I was definitely a bit hesitant when I first went. They’re not my first choice but if Chefs Cafe or Kezira are closed then I will go here so definitely top 3 for Ethiopian restaurants although unlike Chefs and Kezira they do not offer Ayeb with your platter, not sure if it’s because it’s a veggie platter or what but their ayeb “house cheese” is priced pretty high at $3 but they do give you a good amount. If you’re an American wanting to try a new place that feels welcoming however still cultural, this is your place but if you’re habesha I suggest ordering to go.",2023-11-04T03:01:36.385Z,0,,57,TRUE,,,5 months ago,,Lunch,,$10–20,Take out,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjdlNWJ3EAE,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,100007882940483575264,,,,

The location is also great. I love Nordstrom and this is located inside the Lish Nordstrom downtown. I would definitely come back for the sheer fact it's a great place to go after a nice shopping trip.",2019-02-11T14:11:25.978Z,0,,37,TRUE,,,5 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbXBfRmZnEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,108504749348933524325,,,,
Taylor Shellfish Oyster Bar,4,"Can't get any fresher.  Great place for seafood.  Not quite a restaurant setting, more of a cafe.  Good wine list as well",2015-10-15T21:11:24.057Z,0,,150,TRUE,,,8 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRM3VxVy1BRRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,,104492342879112606600,,,,
Bai Tong Thai Street Cafe,5,"Wow!!! Can I just end there? Ok, no. I had an amazing dining experience at Bai Tong Thai Street Cafe restaurant! The wait staff were incredibly friendly and attentive throughout the meal, making me feel truly welcome. The food preparation was excellent, and every dish tasted authentic and delicious, transporting me back to Thailand with each bite. I ordered Northeastern Thai Sausage to start. Crispy Mussels Pancake as my main course. Finished off with Bua Lou Thai desert. I can't wait to return and savor those incredible flavors again!",2023-09-08T21:08:33.099Z,1,,6,FALSE,,,7 months ago,,Lunch,,$50–100,Dine in,5,5,5,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaMnIzV2dRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJaJ_LFRXYMn-NWVRfrFBLs0DYfeYpzb0nogCC=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcLdfJuARtyTSFtkliwBru8NFp6yTPXJbrEl5W=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvPb8AdJpszNwlUHDNE2DkRDkBlTRxRn-5HHom=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqziIg-JwVJ_nbehijiteNevmQjQNtXRMf5UAM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoc8mrdgWsaQaa-CQ4anph1BWIDBEIv-jbebVc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR1WE-N1xZCZuaxozAi_BNYDMp6ByCd7x17ww2=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaASGxXXizab2BOEMcfIMKPiTmst8pVi4aWHjh=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,Google,,108367038440127913643,,,,
Bai Tong Thai Street Cafe,5,"Gosh! What a thai cafe it is! I really thai food specially Panang & green curry, so happened to hit by this restaurant while taking a long walk in Capitol Hill.
This cafe is located right at the centre of Cap Hill, with no parking facility (but you can get Turbocharges & gas station with 500 yards).
I tried green chicken curry (oh man, those kafir lime leaves flavor 😍 in it), Tofu fries & a glass of wheat beer stout.
Everything was amazing, do not expect to get free portion of rice, you need to pay extra $3 for it (but that’s ok 😊).
Tofu fries were sumptuous with cherry & peanut sauce.
Ambiance is great, staff is really helpful.
I would come to this place again!",2023-02-22T07:28:16.381Z,1,,151,TRUE,2023-04-20T22:36:15.314Z,,a year ago,,Dinner,,$30–50,Dine in,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeTRxQzFRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsMC7oYFiCmBIQ6OpE_wp36z-NOnDjKHC1IoTJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo-uYogvxUVCW1sPps9GR8eT887G_cprNhjiir=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOE0jATTR5Hldz0625aJz3ILt-J9VM2EIVhtEZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiIgSZ2qoF1WXx9okvRW99qCtUPuQWfM-RuFPU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWN2kwdlGHpkGUcCFIE7ACQWYrcolqfpW6cwXN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObyVn3JV8Au2abnVFlOuQvXwTj_bpwBMVm_TdS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmyrSQTfTyNmCHnBT_lubXm_VPCa6F7od2tOmx=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNZVKAXXkPJtGex7yc1VOvx1pYYP5zw8FownMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy0pQjQzULRtEIUgiK3xaLbFeIhLwHWg4cszX0=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx7CUCVq7Ml2BzbWwIrtG3iPiIxQEIpm_TJ2oI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM57bFkUV8JVdJOHlZS5XoAzB8kVO0W8EWFq5HK=w150-h150-k-no-p,Google,,116605603715103941771,,,,
