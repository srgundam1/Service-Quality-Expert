"I recently had lunch at Love & Light and it was fantastic! The meal was both delicious and healthy, with a refreshing smoothie that left me feeling energized. Choosing from their diverse menu was tough, but every option was tempting. I loved the Buddha bowl with salmon. Portion was generous, allowing me to enjoy leftovers the next day. I highly recommend this spot to anyone in the neighborhood looking for great healthy food and a welcoming atmosphere! Can't wait to go back! :)",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdlB6TUJnEAE,Boston,en
I had my daughters baptism with about 13 adults and 4 kids and I cannot express how happy I am for selecting Estrella Latina as hosts. The staff were amazing and attentive to all of my guests needs. The owner herself made sure the process of planning was a piece of cake and stress free which was definitely a plus for me. We all felt super comfortable and like we were at home. The food and drinks were 100% amazing! No complaints at all I would definitely choose this place for any of my other events!,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsMWI3ay13RRAB,New York,en

"If I get back to New Orleans, this will be my first choice of restaurant for lunch for dinner. They have a separate vegan menu with a great selection, and it was tough to decide what to order. My husband, sister, brother-in-law, and I were all thrilled with what we had and that we discovered this place. (Thank you Happy Cow!) (We all had the tofu satay; I had the Green Curry Tofu; hubby had the Khao Soi Tofu soup; sis had the Pumpkin Curry Tofu; brother-in-law had the spicy fried eggplant. Everything was delicious. The tea was great too.)

"This is our one of the favorite Indian food restaurant in Atlanta and it’s on the top of the list. We come here to celebrate special occasions.

Yesterday, we ordered some dishes that we have never tried here before.

Kurkuri Bhindi was perfect and excellent.

Paneer Vindaloo was as expected spicy but we couldn’t stop eating it until it was finished.

We requested some food without onion and garlic (I know some of you will ) My wife doesn’t eat them and we were given couple of choices and she picked Paneer Saag and Daal Tadka. They were both good.

Masal soda Limca and Chilli mango mojito were spot on.

Why 4/5 stars? Roomali Roti was little less warm, almost on cold side and that makes it not so pleasant. Otherwise, everything else was perfect.

Staff is always at their best, making sure the guests feels they are special and satisfied.

Ambience and location draws us here over and over again.

Until next celebration, we will cherish this visit.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0c3ZuNTNBRRAB,Atlanta,en

FOR $20 I received some brown meat that was suppose to be “general gaus chicken” but it was more like frozen orange chicken from the grocery store.The plate is so small that you can’t even go back for seconds.On top of everything the older man at the register was very rude.Even the Spanish guy in the back that was cooking shook his head because of the man’s nasty attitude.NEVER AGAIN,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsMW9iN3dRRRAB,Boston,en

"Dined here for the second time and it was one of the worst dining experiences in the city.  We came for the Jazz Brunch and had high hopes, but everything went down hill after we were sat.   We waited about 10 mins for anyone to approach us and we received water and bread.  Then we waited and waited more.  Finally a server said to us he will be right with us, well that was a lie cause 20 mins later someone else who was checking on the dining room took our order.   The food came out at a decent pace but we never met our server,  we didn't even know his name til he greeted another table an hour into our meal. His name is Mike. We were ignored because he was spending all his time with the table next to us.  I recommend you trying other places than this one.

I would say this restaurant was spectacular in the past.  Now it has wait staff that are tired of loud tourists that dress in sweats and wear caps during dinner and laugh far too loud and only leave the Midwest every 5 years for a vacation.  The service was what I would call angry and when someone rips the menu out of your hand and is rude you know you are in for a ride.  After 15 min of not being served and threatening to leave you get service….well.  The food was good but I wonder why restaurants feel that everything needs spice.  Bisque was far too salty and too much chili for the crab.  Steak was good because we said don’t season it we will do it ourselves.  The building is old and interesting  but if you are a tourist go there if you are not a tourist and more discriminating you would know better not to go here for dinner anyway,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENnFiTjF3RRAB,Washington,en

"I was told they do not use habenaro peppers, the peppers that make food hot pepper hot    . It is used to infuse flavor into Jamaican dishes but removed before it bursts into the dish. Or if it is used, they chop it and remove seeds where most of the heat lies dependent upon how ripe the pepper is. Or it can be leftbin the dish to burst for both the heat and flavor. However, not everyone can stand that Scoville scale of a hot pepper in their food. I appreciate that this establishment does not use pepper in their food.  It burns my stomach and other things. Though I was told at another restaurant, Jamaican food is ""supposed to be hot  🥵"", okay. But not everyone can eat peppery food.

Our server Derrick was really nice and I always appreciate someone with a smile. We also tried their version of a hurricane called a ""The  Flamingo"" its one of the best drinks we've had in New Orleans and I highly recommend trying it. I think we drank three each during lunch.
This is also a beautiful setting to have some day drinks at but be aware there are a lot of little birds around so don't leave your food unattended. The house band was also good and not too loud. We would eat here again.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqc2NlOWV3EAE,New Orleans,en

"Oh. My. God. If you’re thinking about going - do it. Immediately.

We originally went as I was looking for a brunch restaurant that could accommodate my dad (he’s in a wheelchair/service dog), and we were also looking for something that prioritizes their food quality. Look, I like NOLA but I was tired of the standard, touristy, overpriced options. The pancakes in the Google listing + ability to make a reservation made the choice easy for us.

When we arrived we were greeted by the co-owner and immediately felt welcomed. It was an awesome surprise to also find that they offered delicious coffee options and we promptly ordered. We ordered an array of coffee (honey cinnamon latte, honey lavender latte, and iced vanilla bean logged - all delicious!) and for food the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, BLT, and Hot Chicken & Honey Biscuit. The pancakes are INCREDIBLE. My mother - who LOVES pancakes - was obsessed with them. The BLT was great and the hot chicken was so-so, but was made up by the delicious potatoes served as a side.

Upon leaving we immediately planned another day to come for breakfast for more pancakes. Upon our second visit we got more pancakes (the lemon + the Pigs in a Blanket), coffees, and the GM Plate. We were all satisfied and became curious on how they created the most perfect pancakes recipe. I’m not kidding - I hate pancakes and will now dream of them.

If you’re considering this place just do yourself a favor and go. Sure, the more “popular” choice is on the corner of the same strip, but it doesn’t compare to this place. Truly. The service, the atmosphere, and the menu are fantastic. Amazing!!

While the prices were on the higher side, the portions were generous—I could have easily shared my meal with two or three people.

"I've been coming to this place now and then since they opened this restaurant because it's close to my house. This is not the one of best szechuan restaurants although I have not found one in NC yet like ones in CA or NY. However, better than or similar to szechuan garden or chengdu 7 in my opinion.

I only had limited number of dishes so far, but here are what I recommend and not recommend:

Not recommend
- General Tso's chicken, it is not typical general tso dish. They use ketchup or tomato based sauce and not spicy at all. Also wish they cut the meat into smaller pieces.

- Kungpao chicken, same reason above

- Beef string bean with garlic sauce, expected clean garlic based sauce, but it had the same flavor of General Tso. Disappointed.

- Lo Mein or Chow Fun, any noodle based dish, they way overcook noodles, so noodles become too mushy and stuck together (see photo)

- Any fried rice, just not good.

- Mushu (Pork) - Super sweet and very little meat, mostly cabbage, wish they use shredded fresh cooked pork, not precooked dry bbq pork (see photo)

Recommend
- Chongqing diced chicken, not the best I've had but pretty good, it is fried (see photo)

- Salt and pepper spare rib, good but it is also fried (see photo)

I will update my review if I try new dishes.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MFBuYUdREAE,Cary,en

"I’ve only been here 3 times and 2 out of those 3 times they’ve gotten my order wrong. Even after specifying and having my order read back to me. I just started coming here last week..so 2/3 times of getting messed up orders is really bad. I can only imagine how many orders they get wrong on a usual if I’ve managed to get 2 times in just the last 4 days. AND THEN THEY DONT ANSWER THE PHONE! You’re told to leave a voicemail but I’ve now ordered this food today and still haven’t received a callback from the first incident the last time I came. The first time we specified no bacon on one of the wraps…we specified why and asked that the bacon be placed on the side to be given to my dog…the bacon was on the side and everywhere in the wrap despite asking specifically for no bacon in the wrap. This time we have a very similar situation but this time, the bacon  isn’t here at all. I asked for it on the side again, and now it’s missing completely. I’ve not been able to check the wraps to make sure they didn’t put it there as well, I will do that and update if needed but this is crazy. And the fact that I have to drive all the way back up there to rectify it because they don’t answer the phone OR I have to simply eat my money and not get what I paid for. I drove back the first time, I’m not doing it this time. If I decide to continue eating at this place at all, I’ll definitely just make take the extra 20 minutes and drive to the one on hulen st. Staff is much more friendly and you can bet your food  will be right. I’ve never had an issue.

UPDATE: YET AGAIN THE WRAP  ITSELF WAS ALSO FILLED WITH BACON. I drove all the way back around 8:45 pm.  I ordered around 4pm and let them know about the messed up Mordor around 3:15/339. Literally opened it and picked the bacon out at the drive through.  I did end  up getting my whole order refunded because this is ridiculous, we have to now go to a whole
Different place to eat because you guys are to incompetent to follow a basic order. NO BACON is like as basic as it gets..how do you mess that u? You rush me through ordering as if you just have it all together just to not get the order right still!! If you’re going to rush me when ordering then  at least get my order right. I will never be back. The workers are literally incompetent imbeciles.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEZ2VuMTZnRRAB,Dallas,en

Their food is very very expensive, almost a double of what we usually pay at other Indian restaurants. But we knew that before going there. Wanted to try once. And it’s a last for us.

"We visited The Boiler Seafood Atlanta on a Friday around 6:30 PM. Fortunately, our server was friendly and attentive. However, we were disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered nearly all the appetizers, but none of them tasted fresh. It was as if they had been prepackaged and came straight from the freezer. For our main course, we ordered lobster bites with fried rice, two different boiler bags, and two orders of Alfredo pasta. Unfortunately, everything in the boiler bags and the fried rice was overcooked, and even the potatoes had sprouted and tasted terrible. When we complained about the taste of one of the boiler bags, they said they couldn't make another one but offered us a free cup of sauce to mask the sour taste. The two orders of Alfredo pasta looked completely different from each other. In one, the sauce was extremely thick, making it almost impossible to pull apart. In the other, the sauce was very watery and resembled soup.

Although the alcoholic drinks we ordered were tasty, they lacked alcohol. If you prefer drinks that are not overly sweet, avoid ordering them. The atmosphere was okay, but it wasn't suitable for families due to the constant hookah smoke and loud music. The parking lot is small, so valet parking is your best option.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqakliVUF3EAE,Atlanta,en

"Going to Cafe Flora used to be my favorite part of being in Seattle. I was glad that they had kept their mouthwatering coconut cake as they continued to innovate, but over the years it went from being a soft cake with tons of coconut in it and subtle undertones of intricate flavors, to being a super dry cake that's overly sweet and just tastes like frosting. It seems that they've changed recipes, or simply stopped putting in the work that they used to. The restaurant is too expensive for what it is now. Their burger also used to be better, I still love the fries though. They don't have enough vegan options considering what is now doable with vegan food. 20 years ago they were surely the best vegetarian restaurant in Seattle, but they need to catch up now. It was a dollar to add vegan mozzarella to the burger, and it tasted like Daiya. Dairy cheese was cheaper to add, so they tax vegans here. Even if it wasn't Daiya, it sure did taste the same.

I ordered a second. The bartender was very difficult to get service from. Eventually I had to leave to catch my flight and I asked to have the food I didn’t receive removed from my bill. The bartender blamed me for not getting the food and said he’d have to wait for a manager to correct my check.

"Excellent service and food. We were pleasantly surprised after seeing other reviews at how wonderful the service was from our arrival through the end of our meal. We requested a change of table twice, due to the location of the (way too many) TV screens everywhere, and the staff was very accommodating.

Our server Luka was outstanding, providing thoughtful recommendations, as well as prompt and friendly service. He went over and above to get our beverages just how we wanted. For food, The charbroiled oysters were a standout- the best out of 3 different spots we’ve tried them in this trip. We also enjoyed the pesto pasta dish, which had a nice balance of fresh and spicy flavors. And the turkey club was good, too.

I didn’t love the blaring TVs everywhere theme. It seems like having the gigantic multiple screen spread over the bar would be plenty for those who are there to watch sports in a group setting. We asked to have the one at our table turned off, and Luka was able to get the volume off, but having the screen playing corny commercials the whole time felt invasive. I’m still going with 5 stars because the service was 10 star caliber!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGcmRLZ1NBEAE,New Orleans,en
"One of my most disappointing experiences with Chick-fil-A occurred recently. Despite having placed numerous large catering orders at various locations in the past, I was shocked by the smaller size of my recent order and the multitude of issues it caused. I placed the order earlier in the day for pickup that evening on the 15th for a party. However, upon arriving at 7:45-7:50 for the 7:30 pickup window, my order was nowhere to be found. When I addressed the issue with the managers and team lead, I was met with a lack of care and attention. Overhearing the assistant general manager and a team lead speaking in Spanish (possibly assuming I didn't understand), I was dismayed to hear them dismiss the situation, claiming it wasn't a big deal because they hadn't seen my order. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, another team lead informed me that it would take another 15-20 minutes to thaw the bread for the sandwiches I ordered, or I could opt for wraps instead. Reluctantly, I agreed to change my order to expedite the process. Finally, an hour past the confirmed pickup time, I received my order, causing me to miss most of the party I was attending. All I received in return for this frustrating experience was an offer for a free milkshake or meal.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa0tEbW9RRRAB,Dallas,en

Try AVELLIO RESTAURANT. THATS A REALLY GOOD, TRUE ITALIAN  RESTAURANT, Rego Park

Those who gave the place a 4 or 5 star just happened to catch them on a good day. JUST WALK ON BY, NO LIE Then if u look at the other reviews, people gave them a ONE STAR. MY FOOD WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT ITALIAN is just n the name. It's not a real Italian restaurant. My food was ordered by a friend. But I don't think they knew anything about the place b4 ordering the parmesan chicken dinner platter. There was very little sauce & cheese on the chicken and not much sauce on the spaghetti. The food was tasteless and worse of all, the chicken was thin & stringy (not the thick chicken breast). It was over cooked & hard to chew The place is n a Spanish populated area & Italian may not b their specialty. Even the other reviews say they hang up on u if u don't speak Spanish - So

The Manso Kosha (goat) was fall apart tender and the sauce was a nice ratio of sweet with a spicy kick. Don't forget to get the Naan to finish off that sauce. We also ordered the chicken biryani that was flavorful and the chicken was tender. For drinks we tried the spicy Rita with tamarind and a gin cocktail with peach, both very tasty. I am so thankful for our server (I wish I remembered his name). He was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations on what to order and tips of how to eat the different food with their chutnies.

"I found myself craving chicken that was both tasty and affordable before I take off for my New York City adventure tomorrow. A couple of months back, I was suggested to check out Hubee D’s in Meyers Park. I'm all about supporting local spots, so I decided to check it out. Walking in, I was warmly greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter—who turned out to be Mark, the owner. We got chatting, and he shared that he's originally from Jersey and boldly claims his chicken could rival any in town. I admire his confidence and passion for his food! Mark, with his rich background in the restaurant industry, dreams of opening a northern-style deli/luncheonette/breakfast spot in the future.

Since this was my first visit, Mark suggested trying something from their menu of scratch-made chicken entrees, including tenders, nuggets, sandwiches, wings, salads, and wraps.

With so much to choose from, I settled on a fried chicken sandwich with pickles and their signature zesty Hubee Sauce—reminiscent of Zaxby's Chicken Sauce—alongside a serving of well-seasoned matchstick French fries and creamy mac & cheese with a white cheddar sauce. Everything was made to order, arriving hot and fresh. When comparing Hubee D’s fried chicken sandwich to that famous chain that's closed on Sundays, Hubee D’s takes the crown. The chicken was perfectly breaded and fried—juicy and crispy. The Hubee sauce added just the right touch without being overpowering, and the bun was perfectly toasted, with the pickles providing a refreshing contrast.

While I usually lean towards baked mac & cheese, Hubee D’s saucy, creamy version was a delightful surprise.  So, if saucy mac & cheese is your thing, don't miss out on this one.
If you've driven past this local gem without stopping, make sure to bring the family next time. There’s something for everyone to enjoy! I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Hubee D’s!

P.S. Sorry for the half-eaten meal photo. I got caught up chatting with Mark and didn't want my food to cool down.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENmRpZlp3EAE,Charlotte,en

"This post was made solely for the sake of the desserts. Whoever you have back there in pastry are putting their hearts and souls into these sweets.

I enjoyed a pistachio cupcake, and my lover a tiramisu. I, upon biting into the middle of the cupcake, took a second to process whether or not this texture was real. The sponge was incredibly soft and fluffy, aerated and moist. The pistachio flavor was present, but subtle. Accompanied by what may have been the finest cream cheese icing I’ve consumed in my life. Candied pistachio pieces scattered on top made for the finest delicacy I’ve had in a while. Simple — executed perfectly.

As for the tiramisu, I can’t say that I’ve historically been a fan of them (too bitter), so my notes on them are notably less. My companion, upon first bite, immediately remarked that it was “very good” with the bite still in his mouth. I found it to be very soft and creamy, with a present but not too powerful taste of espresso. The ladyfingers were soft and crumbly; the whipped topping a cloud resting on my tongue. My only note is that the overall texture was very monotone. I think a crunchier ladyfinger would lend some liveliness to the dish.

But yes, phenomenal desserts that deserve a special review and shoutout! ",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeHNHOXR3RRAB,Atlanta,en

"Poor service and rude owner..

When my group arrived here I opened the front door without stepping in in order to ask if we could be seated outside.  The host rudely yelled at me to put a mask on. My intention was to sit outside to avoid digging out a mask but rather then simply tell me I could go ahead and have a seat the host wouldn't answer me until I put one on. He then told me I could sit at 2 tables. Half of my group was already there and we took a seat at one table.  The server walked by our table twice but did not greet us. The rest of my group arrived and took a seat at the other table.  They had a separate server that brought them water immediately.  My table continued to wait so I went to ask if we had a server coming.  A server told me he would be right with us. I apologized but told him my boyfriend needed to get to the airport soon.  He brought waters to our table.  At that time he took our food and drink order. The second table had their food order taken about 5 minutes after us. All of their food came out more than 10 minutes before ours. After waiting a total of 45 minutes after giving our order my boyfriend went in to ask them to box our food and pay the bill as we no longer had time to eat.  It seemed that the slow service was purposeful as we were overlooked several times.

I was also not impressed with the food.  Small portions and over priced.

Once learning of my poor experience I was contacted by the owner.  Rather then apologize for the bad experience he berated and name called me for writing the review.

"My wife and I had a terrible experience with this establishment. There were warning signs early that we ignored, so ultimately we could have avoided our lackluster dining experience.
We walked up to the hostess station and were greeted by a young woman who was in the middle of dealing with her false eyelashes falling off, so we waited while she dealt with her personal emergency. She was very nice and apologetic for it, I'm sure that she was quite embarrassed. The restaurant wasn't busy at the moment, maybe a total of 5 tables, this is a large restaurant. We waited roughly 5 minutes for our server to greet us, placed a drink order along with an appetizer order. The server brought our waters and said our drinks would be out shortly. We started hearing the kitchen yelling for service for several minutes, the wait staff were elsewhere at this point, and then we started seeing the kitchen staff attempting to bring out the orders themselves. They were obviously confused as the whole each item was supposed to go to, but they were making an attempt. Kudos to the back of house for making an effort. They did make some negative comments about their coworkers as they were returning to the kitchen, we were sat by the kitchen so got to be the audience.

We received our appetizer after a few minutes of it being passed around from person to person before finally making it's way to our server.
We waited 10 minutes for our drinks to finally make it to our table, not promising for such a large business that wasn't busy. We had ordered the crab cake appetizer, it was very small, good flavor and quite a lot of crab for what looks like a 3 ounce cake. I would have been a little happier for either a little more or little less expensive ($26), this is obviously in the heart of the tourist trap but this was egregious even with that in mind. My entree was delivered within minutes of the drinks and appetizer. I had ordered the Blue Bayou shrimp Poboy, I was surprised by how much shrimp was on the sandwich especially after how small the appetizer was. My food sat on the table untouched for nearly 10 minutes before our server came to check on us, finding my wife's entree had never been delivered. She went back to the kitchen to check, came back out to apologize and said that the missing entree would be delivered shortly. We waited another 15 minutes for my wife's shrimp and grits entree, my food was now cold and we began eating our dinner.
The Poboy was not bad, even for being cold, it lacked some of the bold flavor you would expect for a Creole BBQ shrimp poboy but was more than edible. The side of fries were very good, large portions of shrimp and fries.
My wife said the shrimp and grits were okay, not as good as the same dish from the Ruby Slipper I had ordered for breakfast on the same day for significantly less money. But she did enjoy the dish well enough.

The server did offer to comp a glass of wine to make amends for the poor timing of the service, we declined and finished our meal. We found the service at this restaurant to be seriously lacking compared to the other establishments we visited during our visit to the city. The prices were on par with higher end establishments, but it falls short of the competition in my experience. We didn't walk in with any expectations, but we left disappointed with the overall experience.  We would not return or recommend this restaurant. There are too many great places to enjoy good food and drink in this city, avoid this lackluster tourist trap.

**Also of note - this restaurant charges an additional 3% on card payments, and they're a cashless business. So expect all prices to be an additional 3%***",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbnVhblFBEAE,New Orleans,en

"I was very hesitant to try this place because of the bad reviews I saw; at the same time I want to try it for myself and see for myself. First impression: a very old & dirty fried chicken restaurant, a step down from Lisa’s Chicken. The price is relatively fair, quite competitive to other fried chicken places. I was able to get a 3pc chicken dinner (2 sides) and a “medium” drink for under $10. The chicken tasted very bland, very greasy and left a bad after taste. I believe they’ve used rotten chicken to fry, very gross, and don’t even get me started with their soggy fries I couldn’t even finish. The drink is not up to its size. I got the medium one ($1.59) and it is very clearly not 24 oz as advertised. It is more like 16 oz. They fill it up with ice so you don’t get the full volume of drink, and they would charge you 50 cents for refill. Because of how this restaurant offers dirt poor quality of food, I was going to give it a 1-star review. However, an extra star rating was given by me because they let me get the refill for free. Not a place to return.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKb3U3MXhnRRAB,Dallas,en

- delicious fries
- really nicely done scallops (crispy on the top and bottom, creamy in the middle)
- gluten free, vegan brownie — fudgey and a great end to the meal

"While the staff at this establishment continue to provide excellent service and food quality, I must mention the deplorable behavior of owner Ericka Burke. Never before have I witnessed such callous, selfish, and reckless actions. When a neighborhood plumbing renovation brought raw sewage water into the restaurant's pipes, Miss Burke demanded to keep the restaurant open even after her staff closed for the day in order to protect customers from serious illness. The implications of her irresponsible wishes in this situation are staggering. This woman should not be allowed to serve food to the public, since she is clearly more concerned with making money than with providing her customers safe food.

Perhaps more repugnant even than allowing raw sewage into her food, is the manner in which Miss Burke treats her staff. I have frequently seen her yell at her serving and cook staff in front of customers, even using profanities with children in the restaurant. In spite of her ridiculously unprofessional behavior, Volunteer Park Cafe's competant staff remains loyal to the local customers who have come to love VPC's family-friendly atmosphere, which is strongly bolstered by baker and co-owner Heather Earnhardt. It is clear to all who visit this restaurant that it is only Heather's efforts and constant presence that keep VPC running smoothly.

Ericka Burke should be ashamed of herself. She obviously wants only to make a name for herself by stepping on the backs of the people below her. Bouncing checks to her food purveyors, failing to pay her employees on time if at all, and providing false information to unemployment services are among some of her frequent improprieties.

I can only trust that some day, her wickedness will come back ten-fold, as it so often does with people as self-serving, greedy, and malicious as this woman.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROWNQck5BEAE,Seattle,en

For the mains there was a mixture of lamb, beef and chicken ordered and everyone enjoyed their meals and accompanying drinks.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5N1lqZkxBEAE,Atlanta,en

"TWO THINGS:

Don't ever come and tell someone how much to tip you when there's no mandatory tip, but only suggestions like every other bill in this country. Especially when services are mediocre at best.

Secondly, don't ever add suggested tips on the total bill. It is always before taxes.

This is the FIRST ever restaurant I've been to in my life that comes back and asks for more tip, and the first one I've noticed that add their suggested tip box on the total after tax. Life is hard as it is already, don't scam people.

I was certainly surprised to say the least by that. Who on earth does that? WOW.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdDktS3pBRRAB,New York,en

When we asked hostess to assist us get our server, server came apologizing and said she was occupied with the birthday party. Server took the order, and told us, she'll give us shared plates, we got appetizers, server was nowhere to be found again, the food runner dropped food and gave shared plates, server came back after 5 mins, and checked on firing entree. Then when entree came in, table was not bussed, food runner was holding plates, we cleaned our own tables. After that for 30 mins did not see server. Getting desserts was a task too as doughnuts take 30 mins to make fresh, it would have been nice if we had a heads up. For a simple meal, it took almost 2 hrs.

He stated he didn't know how to refund the tax. So I asked for a manager, and he said they couldn't reach them anymore for the evening. They have poor communication skills, work slowly, and will not make eye contact.
To the person who refunded us the money I checked my bank account, and it does refund the whole amount with sales tax despite the refund receipt provided.

Even though I've had a lot of Philly's with the traditional sub bread, this cheesesteak sub was off the charts. Let me tell you how good it is.

"Today, we were incredibly fortunate to visit a unique restaurant, Monocle, located on Capitol Hill. We initially chose it due to its proximity to our hotel, but it turned out to be a true ""Washingtonian gem."" Opened in 1960, this restaurant has been operated by the same family ever since. The menu is concise, which we believe highlights the culinary excellence presented in merely five dishes. We were in search of ""authentic American steaks from real American beef from real American cows."" What we received far exceeded our expectations. Both steaks we ordered were exquisitely prepared to perfection. We both agreed that these were the best steaks we've ever had the pleasure of eating in our lives. #Masterpiece

As if the meal itself wasn't enough, our server, Marinos Apostolopoulos, provided us with a genuine journey through the history of this establishment. We are deeply grateful!

Given its location near the Capitol, the restaurant has been visited by at least half of American politicians over the last 60 years, including Presidents Nixon, Kennedy, Bush, and Clinton. Celebrities like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, among other incredible individuals, have also frequented this place. The number of VIPs and their dedications displayed in their own photos hanging on every wall is truly astonishing.

One of the servers celebrated his 50th work anniversary here two months ago with a surprise party for 250 people, an event that was featured on the front page of the Washington Post, which we had the opportunity to read.

The place is beautiful, with incredibly friendly service and excellent food. The wonderful experiences we had will stay with us forever. It's worth traveling for moments like these.

We highly recommend it and would love to return someday.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbHVxaU5BEAE,Washington,en

"My first time trying this place. Let me say that the food was delish. My issue is that the staff were in the dining area having curse filled conversations like they were at home among friends. Not even a patron who drank too much but the staff. I found it unprofessional and a bit insulting that it didn't occur to them that I didn't want to hear b-words, f-bombs & other crude language while trying to enjoy my Fri after work much less their silly & inane conversation.

It was extremely off-putting so I'm unlikely to go back & other locations aren't convenient enough for me to want to drive there. I'm at a loss to understand why mgmt would allow them to stand around where patrons are & can easily overhear every word they're saying. I have to assume they're okay with it because clearly the person I assumed was the mgr as he stopped & asked about my food could see & hear too because they were right there. Then, there was the one who came from the kitchen and slouched across one of the seats while he talked on his cell. Yep could hear his convo too.

The burger & my server who was not part of the group congregated near me were great, but the atmosphere they created made my Fri afterwork outing quite unpleasant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENGJiblhREAE,Charlotte,en

"The worst experience in my 30 years dining history, not only forced to pay 18%tips, but also charged 3% more paid by credit card",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGX29Qd053EAE,New York,en
"By far my worst experience with any pizza hut. We accepted the 1 hour wait time. When the delivery guy (later identified as a PH worker vs door dash per the store worker after calling back) came, we were given 2 boxes and a wings container. One pizza box was entirely EMPTY! Who in their right mind seals an empty box and then also doesn't notice how EMPTY it feels?

After calling back. The worker offered to either get a redelivery (an extra hour wait ) or store credit. The 1 star given was for the store worker who offered a credit in an amount more than the product that we ordered, which is fair due to the inconvenience and hunger my family endured after not receiving the amount of food we prepared for. Thank you store worker for making it a bit better and for apologizing on behalf of the business.
I'll have to go in person to use my credit next time however that will likely be the last time I'll give my business to that specific franchise.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEZ09xRVRnEAE,Dallas,en

Everything mixed well in my bowl but left me wishing I had a bit more lettuce in mine definitely will order extra 🥬 next time.
