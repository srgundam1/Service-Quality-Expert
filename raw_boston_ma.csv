Sloane‚Äôs,4,"Menu is a bit ""limited"", but I got the steak and potatoes, and it has definitely surpassed my expectations. Portions were definitely enough for me.

Steak, I'd give a solid 7.5, maybe 8/10. Good texture. Good taste. Very good. Would recommend.

Mashed Potatoes, I've had a lot of places that had very mediocre mashed potatoes where I would just leave it on my plate, but these mashed potatoes with the gravy were pretty good and I finished all of it. Perfect amount of gravy for the mashed potatoes, too. 7-7.5/10.

Carrots, I'm not a fan of carrots generally speaking. For carrots, these were good. Like 6/10 above average good. But the entire time I was eating the carrots, I just thought to myself, ""I wish these were sweet potatoes... but maybe that's just too much potato in the entree"".

Adding this place to my mental list of ""places to go to for a good steak"". I'm definitely going to have my family and friends try this place to get their opinions as well as try their other dishes.",2024-04-22T19:18:36.769Z,0,,66,TRUE,,,a day ago,,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREX0xyYWd3RRAB,,,,,,,Google,,114934463886661600948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tonight I ordered a too good to go last minute. Work finished late so I was starving. But it was 10 minutes before they closed. I called to make sure they would have at least one order left before telling them I will be there in the next couple minutes.
When I got there the door was locked and they told me somebody else picked up the toogood order. I wasn‚Äôt even mad, just disappointed. But Ritchie was kind enough to offer to make me a sandwich.
I told him I would take anything.

Here I am eating one of the best chicken cutlets ever. Tomato, lettuce, onion bacon and an aoli sauce. But the secret ingredient is love. This will be my to go spot from now on.

Midnight Morning,5,"I‚Äôm so happy this place is in our neighborhood! I most recently ate here for dinner with two adults and a toddler.

Highlights:
- The restaurant team were great ‚Äî kind, present, but not pushy
- they are very kid-friendly ‚Äî they got us set up right away with a high chair, and the mac and cheese on the kids menu was great by kid and adult standards
- the tonkatsu sandwich was great
- delicious fries
- really nicely done scallops (crispy on the top and bottom, creamy in the middle)
- gluten free, vegan brownie ‚Äî fudgey and a great end to the meal

The Cajun Fries were some of the best we‚Äôve had and the garlic noodles pair well with this hearty meal.

Depending on your spending tier, you get free food. We got a free lobster!

Carrot cake was very moist and tasty. The red velvet was okay, the frosting was creamy, but the cake was lacking moistness and was a little dry. Definitely opt for the carrot cake!

Dragon Chef,1,"So I order using the online menu, and I‚Äôm appalled that when I picked up my order, it was $10 more than the online menu indicated.  I order 1 dinner (fried rice/2 appetizers) and small side order of Peking Ravioli (total of 4).  Cost of $24.40.  I could have splurged on Chipotle for far less and much better food.  I mentioned to the female cashier about the discrepancies of the online menu and she immediately became defensive, explaining that the online menu had been updated.  I responded that obviously some advertisers did not get the memo. She persisted to the point where I said, look, it is what it is. You haven‚Äôt informed your public and that‚Äôs on you. She blamed her boss and said she‚Äôd inform him.  I doubt I‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôd experienced surprise, and the first time she said she‚Äôd tell her boss.  I‚Äôd guess the next time she tells her boss WILL BE THE FIRST TIME though.

The food?  I‚Äô‚Äôm from Roslindale and patronized this same business since 1980 or so when it opened. Original manager was fabulous. You went in, he knew what you wanted, we talked baseball the whole time, he was a huge fan. The neighborhood owned him. He was one of us. Always the tastiest food.  Today I ordered Kung Pao extra spicy, Egg Roll, and Peking Ravioli side.  Fried rice was part of the dinner component.  I‚Äôve never tasted Kung Pao Chicken so tasteless.  Spicy?  Milk has more zest to it than this slop. And it didn‚Äôt look like a good quality dish, chicken, vegetable, etc. no peanuts which always is part of the dish. Sub par as to appetizing view. Terrible food. Egg Roll was ok. Peking‚Äôs, nothing to stop in or go out of your way for.

Being a customer of this place for over 40 years?  No more.  Done.  There are plenty of Chinese food restaurants right there in Rossie Square.  I‚Äôll give them a try.  I hope this review provides you with some forwarded insight.

The food was really good, always served hot. We were 7 people and We each individuslly ordered a bag. (It was quite a lot actually) for a party of 7 I think 5 bags would be enough.  We all tried the  shaking sauce and it was really good. Really great spices.  Honestly this was an amazing experience, We had an entire bag left over.

Shaking Seafood (Roslindale),1,"I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, it was a complete letdown. From start to finish, the service was appalling and left a sour taste in my mouth.

Upon entering, there was no warm welcome or acknowledgment from the staff. We had to wait for what felt like an eternity before anyone bothered to seat us, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.

Once seated, the wait for our orders was excruciatingly long. It took ages for a server to even come to our table to take our drink orders, and when they finally did, they seemed disinterested and unfriendly.

When the food finally arrived, it was subpar at best. The dishes were lukewarm, indicating they had been sitting out for some time before being served. Not to mention, the presentation was sloppy, and it was evident that little care went into preparing our meals.

To make matters worse, when we tried to address our concerns with the manager, they were dismissive and unapologetic. Instead of acknowledging our dissatisfaction, they brushed us off and seemed uninterested in resolving the issues.

Overall, my experience at Shaking Seafood Restaurant was incredibly disappointing. The lackluster service, mediocre food quality, and indifferent management left me feeling frustrated and unlikely to return.

Lala Caribbean restaurant,5,"I googled Haitian restaurants nearby and spotted this one. I parked my car and said hmmmm this is a tiny place‚Ä¶hey let me try it anyways. I went in and the gentlemen behind the counter was so professional and kind. I‚Äôve complimented him because in my opinion it is very hard to find an all around great Haitian restaurant or Haitian food business. I came in and didn‚Äôt know what I wanted. He walked me through making up my mind. He had patience, a great tone of voice, honesty, great listening skills and such a positive energy. This is exactly what ANY restaurant should be like.

The food was amazing - GREAT PORTION ‚≠êÔ∏è I ordered du ri jon jon ( black rice - most people call it but the correct name is dried mushroom rice ) with legumes and baked macaroni and Soup Joumou! YUMMY !!!!!! The legumes was amazing because it didn‚Äôt have too much acid in it. Some places love to add acid or too much spice to the legumes but this one was perfect! The rice was amazing also because it was fully cooked. I really don‚Äôt like ordering this kind of dish or ANY and Haitian food that is not fully cooked! I applaud this place!

I rarely write reviews but when I do it‚Äôs serious! I would like to also say I applaud the owner for believing in him and hiring him. This man will go far in life. Please continue to support employees like him. I have to also give a round of applause to the people in the back who put their work in making the food as well. I just can‚Äôt write this review and forget the employees in the back. They are part of the business as well! It‚Äôs not easy waking up everyday cooking and serving people - it can be challenging. I applaud this place. For such a small place to eat-the service and food is amazing! This goes to say never judge a book by its cover. You never know the greatness it has.

Please continue to do well in the community. I appreciate your business!

Sincerely,

Canton Eatery,1,"This is my first review for a restaurant in my life. Delivery driver Siu Yan lost his temper on me in public because my messages were full, but I have a screenshot proving I called him and that was a literal two minute difference between his first call and my being at his vehicle, I tipped almost $5 for a 0.3 mile ride. The guy hit the gas and sped off in the middle of my taking the food from him and apologizing, he yelled at me for not answering the phone?! Usually good food and service, I have been a regular for a few years now and had no issue with them at all in any way, it has always been great. I haven't had another adult give sass like a little girl before, but I'll be going elsewhere from now on.

Considering the restaurant? Go inside and see for yourself how Clean it is. I have pictures of that too since it was the topic of discussion at our family's house that we worried the place was a tad dirty, but they knew us by name and were always nice. Too bad really.

Chinese Dragon,5,"Recently, I ordered delivery food from Chinese Dragon. I had zero expectations (either way) for their food; it was late, but their kitchen was open and they were willing to deliver to my slightly out-of-range location for a small, additional delivery fee. (A paltry $ amount, compared to the ridiculous/endless delivery and service fees Uber Cheats, Grub Nub, etc. tack on to every order.)

45 minutes later, my food arrived -- and it was wonderful! Creamy egg drop soup; perfect saucy chicken saut√©ed to perfection with a colorful mix of tasty chinese vegetables; delicious chicken fried rice (replete with real, large chunks of meat throughout); admidst this abundance though the rich, tender beef teriaki skewers were actually the first thing to be devoured. (I would usually save one for later but hey...life is short and their siren song called me.) So good!

In summary, I still can't believe that I polished off so much food, so easily at 1am...or that there were so many (non-teriaki) leftovers the next day.

Chinese Dragon,1,"NOT RECOMMENDED. Recently moved to the area from NJ and wanted to support businesses in the area. Most Chinese food places in NJ/NY make flavorful and fresh food; not this place.

Food: The food isn‚Äôt fresh, no flavor. The fried rice was pulled from a rice pot, oily with no vegetables and heavy on the soy sauce. My entire meal was mostly rice with a few strips of spareribs. The crab ragoons were refried so the top was crispy but the bottom was soggy.

Service: Felt rushed, and oddly uncomfortable. They treated me as if I was going to steal something constantly asking me if I was ready to order. Again, first time here so I was reading the menu.

Saigon Hut,3,"It saddens me to write this review, I really enjoy this restaurants' food and atmosphere; it is very homey. However I just want other customers to know to be wary when ordering take out. It happened twice to me. The restaurant uses a website called Skipli which uses Doordash as third party. If your order is lost or damaged, the restaurant will do never about it and tells you to contact the driver or website. Doordash can't do anything either.  Skipli does not even have a way to contact them since it is a marketing site. The first time the restaurant forgot the added veggies I had paid for. Since it was 5 dollars and I just brushed it off. The second time the driver had taken my drinks. Please do not use their skipli website to order food.",2024-01-05T23:42:00.597Z,0,,12,TRUE,,,3 months ago,,,,,,,,4,3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxX0lpOXN3RRAB,,,,,,,Google,,105970492498647268203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saigon Hut,3,"We ordered three different bowls of pho and they were mediocre at best; a little bland for our taste and lacked the aromatics and depth of flavor.  Could have also been because it was dinner time and the broth wasn't as fresh.  The atmosphere was what you would expect from a hole in the wall restaurant.  The service was bad.  We ordered Goi Ga (salad w/ chicken) as our appetizer and never got it.  We never got waters or even offered if we wanted drinks.  They didn't know what fish sauce was so definitely no Vietnamese working that evening.  After 3 tries, he did eventually figure out what we were asking for.  Our server seemed to be hiding in the kitchen most of the time.  We waited a long time after finishing our food before I had to go back there to get him to get our bill.  Friendly but not a good server.

Saigon Hut,1,"Stopped by from out of town, the kids were craving Pho and this place got good reviews.  We were disappointed to say the least. Went in didn't get service for quite some time, when the server finally came we were never offered water or drinks and he didn't clean the table which was dirty from the previous customer. We waited a long time to order, our appetizer never came, the pho came out with no limes and the jalapenos were cut huge. Like one jalapeno cut into 4 large peices. Then we asked for fish sauce because the pho needed it. The staff didn't know what fish sauce is. What kind of vietnamese restaurant doesn't know what fish sauce is? Finally got some limes and fish sauce after explaining to the all non vietnamese staff what it is. Once the Pho was flavored with fish sauce and lime it was acceptable.  We can't say anything about the other dishes because they never brought them but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who likes service in a restaurant.",2024-01-01T13:52:20.644Z,0,,6,FALSE,,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,,,,1,3,1,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxLWRqMU13EAE,,,,,,,Google,,115835617374370361426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The food is also very irregular, sometimes it is fresh and juicy (the chicken) and sometimes it is very dry as if it is already overcooked.

It was the best one I ever had. I love the sauce so much. It tastes smooth but not sour. Usually I‚Äôll have some stomach upset after I eat tomato sauce dishes.

Rino's Place,1,"BEWARE OF THE SECRET RESERVATION LIST!!

It is very well advertised that this is a ‚Äúno reservations taken‚Äù restaurant. We learned the hard way that you actually CAN make reservations (by emailing the owner directly).

So, when we put our name in for a group of 4 at 6:30 pm and the hostess told us there were only 3 tables ahead of us, we were more than happy to wait as we had been wanting to try this spot for a long time. 2 hours after patiently waiting outdoors (you can‚Äôt wait indoors here), and after watching many groups stroll in to their RESERVED tables, we decided to check in with the hostess. Her advice was that we should have made a reservation by contacting the owner directly.

So, if you find yourself waiting for a table here, just know that the empty table you see through the window may just remain empty until a limo full of people with a secret reservation arrives for their 8:15 reservation.

Easy fix: instead of leading on to your customers that they are the third ones in line for a table, tell them the truth (we have some large parties tonight, special event or request, etc). If we knew the truth, we would have simply returned another night.

UPDATE:
Although still confused and disappointed that I could not get a phone answered before heading to Luna's - once we arrived we were treated very well. Every accommodation was made to service us to our liking. The foods were varied, fresh and delicious!! You could tell the chef and staff take great care and pride. The place is IMMACULATE!! A must for me when dining out. I loved the Latin cuisine infusion to traditional dishes. The servings were ample enough by my measure [I'm not a glutton and understand portion control] and aside from being delicious everything was fresh and prepared to order. Unlike many who commented here, we did not find rude, neglectful staff on hand; nor did we find the prices outrageous for these ""Biden's - Build Back Better"" out of control inflationary times. If they put on a general recording on the phone to answer FAQ, this would be a huge help. But answering the phone is even better!! We merely needed to know if they in fact were OPEN and hadn't succumbed to a Biden Administration induced demise. We were happy to learn they hadn't!!

Saltie Girl,5,Came for the seafood but stayed for the cocktails and chill vibes. We sat at bar so did not get a chance to get familiar with menu or hear about dishes. The oysters were great! Did not like raw clams (too fishy for my taste). Cocktails were suburb. They had a lobster and waffle dish which was so unique and good! Lobster was a bit overcooked but the flavor they had def made up for probably a rare mistake (the lobster in lobster roll was not overcooked and melted in mouth).

Saltie Girl,2,"I post a review on Google only for something exceptionally good or exceptionally bad; unfortunately, Saltie Girl was the latter.

I wanted a quick clam chowder lunch before heading home, and Saltie Girl had been mentioned more than once as making a good one. What a disappointment! It was over-thickened, over-salted, under-clammed, and for some odd reason served topped by two fried clams with breading that had already turned soggy.

And speaking of soggy, the French fries were limp as can be. They were listed on the menu as having black garlic and truffle, but truffle flavor (truffle salt?) was all I could taste. I did see some black specs, which I hoped and assumed were some sort of edible item, but otherwise the garlic was absent.

The host was courteous and helpful (this was the only reason I gave two stars instead of one), but the server committed a major faux pas for a higher-end restaurant by not asking, after I ate only half of the chowder and maybe a quarter of the fries, if I was unhappy with the food.

I also ordered a shiso cocktail, which tasted mostly of citrus and sugar, a little bit of gin, and not at all of shiso except for one tired leaf affixed to the glass by an adorable little clothespin.",2024-04-19T15:03:29.081Z,0,,11,FALSE,,,5 days ago,,Lunch,,$30‚Äì50,,Dine in,2,1,2,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa3RPdHJ3RRAB,,,,,,,Google,,100786855312252807422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This restaurant has PLENTY of wait staff, they are all just condescending, rude, and make you wait on yourself. Service on a Saturday at 3pm was abysmal despite a plethora of servers.

Lulu's Allston,3,"I think this could be a great Sunday brunch spot - or maybe it already is and we just had bad luck.  Two of our four meals were delicious, but the two breakfast burritos were a disaster.  They got the order wrong several times and even the third attempt still had sausage in it when we requested vegetarian.  It also wasn't very tasty.  The waitress was doing her best despite the kitchen problems and ended up taking one of the two burritos off of the bill which was appreciated.

We would consider going back but will definitely not be ordering the breakfast burrito.",2024-03-12T10:03:55.542Z,0,,181,FALSE,,,a month ago,,Brunch,,$10‚Äì20,,Dine in,5,3,3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dXBiTkp3EAE,,,,,,,Google,,104864155779698035175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
